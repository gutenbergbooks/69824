<h2>SERMON, &amp;c.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Psalm CXIX.</span> v. 59.</h3>

<p><i>I called mine own ways to remembrance: and
turned my feet unto thy testimonies.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> great object of this day’s solemnity, is,
<i>to humble ourselves before Almighty God, in
order to obtain pardon of our sins</i>. But this
end requires, that we enter into an earnest recollection
of our <i>ways</i>, and stedfastly resolve
to <i>forsake</i> all those, which we shall find reason
to condemn.</p>

<p>Such is the example set us by the royal author
of the text: And, though it might claim
our respect at all times, it especially does so,
at this juncture, when our sins have brought
down upon us the heaviest of those judgments,
with which it pleases God to visit, and, if it
may be, to reclaim, offending nations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p>And the hand of Heaven is not the less, but
the more visible in this calamity, for it’s befalling
us, when the acknowledged power of
our country seemed to secure it against all resistance,
both within and without; and when
it was not to be expected, from the usual course
of human affairs, that an attempt of this nature,
so unprovoked, at once, and so hazardous,
would be made. Something there must have
been, much amiss in that people, against whom
the Almighty permits the sword of civil fury,
under <i>such</i> circumstances, to be drawn.</p>

<p>From what <i>causes</i>, and by what <i>steps</i>, this
portentous mischief hath grown up to it’s present
size and terror, it is not needful, and may
not be proper, for me to say. For which of us
is unacquainted with these things? And how
ill suited to the modest piety of this day would
be, the vehement accusation of others, or the
sollicitous justification of ourselves!</p>

<p>Yet, among the various pretences, which
have served to pervert the judgments of many,
<span class="smcap">One</span> is so strange, and of so pernicious a tendency,
were it to be generally admitted, that a
word or two cannot be misemployed in the
censure of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

<p>It is in the order of things, that they who,
for any purpose, wish to draw the people into a
scheme of resistance to an established government,
should labour to impress them, first of
all, with a persuasion of their being ill governed.
Acts of tyranny and oppression are, therefore,
sought out with diligence; and invented, when
they cannot be found: And the credulous
multitude have but too easily, at all times, lent
an ear to such charges.</p>

<p>But it is quite new, and beyond measure
extravagant, to tell us, That, although there be
no considerable abuse of the government, as it
now stands, we are bound in conscience to resist
it, because such abuse is possible, and because
a more desirable form of government may
be conceived. And yet, to the disgrace of an
age, calling itself philosophical, such sophistry
has passed, not on the multitude only, but, as
it is said, on wise men.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it would be unjust to
say, that speculations on the nature and end of
government are, therefore, useless or even hurtful,
because we see them, in the present instance,
so egregiously misapplied. Theories on
government, when framed by sober and thinking
men, cannot but be of great importance, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
serving to remind both the governors and governed
of their respective interests and duties;
nay, and as tending ultimately to improve establishments
themselves; but by degrees only,
and by constitutional means. Our own excellent
establishment has, in this way, been much
improved: And we surely owe our thanks to
those theorists, whose generous labours have
contributed to this end.</p>

<p>But to apply these theories, how reasonable
soever in themselves, directly to the correction
of established governments, and to insist, that
force may, or should, be called in to realize
these visions, is a sort of fanaticism, which, if
suffered to take it’s course, would introduce
the utmost confusion into human affairs; would
be constantly disturbing, and must, in the end,
subvert, the best government, that ever did,
or ever can, subsist in the world.</p>

<p>Thus much, then, in reproof of so wild and
destructive a principle, I could not help saying
in the entrance of a discourse, which, to suit
the occasion, should have little of altercation
and dispute; and which, agreeably to the text,
must turn chiefly on the great duties of Recollection
and Repentance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>But what, you will say, “Is a criminal enterprize,
like this, which occasions our present
meeting, to be charged on those only, against
whom it is directed? And must we be the
worst of sinners, because there are those of our
fellow-subjects, who have taken up arms against
their Sovereign?”</p>

<p>Far be it from me to affirm either of these
things! Yet he was a wise man, who said,
that, <i>when a man’s ways please the Lord, he
maketh even his enemies to be at peace with
him</i><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>: And I think it clear from the tenour of
scripture, and even from our own experience,
that no national distress is ever inflicted, before
it is deserved.</p>

<p>And the conviction of this sad truth is
ground enough for us to turn ourselves to the
great work of Repentance; which does not require
us to form discouraging, or indeed any,
comparisons between ourselves and the enemies
we contend with, but to call to mind
that we have, indeed, merited the evil, we
suffer, whether brought upon us immediately
by our own sins, or those of other men. A
civil war is the most dreadful of those instruments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
by which the moral government of God
is administered in this world. And, <i>when such
a judgement is in the earth</i>, be our comparative
merits what they may, we shall do well to <i>learn
righteousness</i><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>But, after all, who, or what are we, that we
should talk of <i>merits</i>, or scruple to place this
alarming visitation of Heaven to the account of
our sins?—Merciful God! Do thou incline
our hearts to follow the example of thy servant,
David, this day, in <i>calling our own ways to remembrance</i>,
and we shall presently see what
need there is for us to <i>turn our feet unto thy
testimonies</i>!</p>

<p>1. To begin from that point, whence all true
worth and goodness, proceeds, I mean, from
<span class="smcap">Religion</span>.</p>

<p>There is no people on the face of the earth,
more deeply indebted to Providence for blessings
of all sorts, spiritual as well as temporal, than
we of this Christian and Protestant nation.
But has our pious gratitude kept pace with
these obligations?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<p>Infinite are the benefits, that descend upon
us from our <small>WELL-REFORMED</small> Religion, and
from the watchful care of Heaven in the support
and protection of it. Yet who reflects on
these things? Should we so much as hear a
word on the subject, if it did not suit the purpose,
sometimes, of peevish men and parties
among us, to revive the memory of it? Have
we even a decent regard for the honour of our
great Reformers? And is not the little zeal,
we have left for Protestantism itself, spent in
idle cavils at the stupendous work, atchieved
by their hands?</p>

<p>But why speak I of <i>reformed</i> religion? Is
there any of us, almost, who is animated with
that zeal for <span class="smcap">Christianity</span> itself, which glowed
in the breasts of our fathers?</p>

<p>Too many proclaim their disbelief of it, nay,
their utter contempt of all that is called Religion;
and yet appear to give no offence (where,
methinks, it should be taken) by their manifest,
their avowed, their ostentatious impieties. Is
it not even growing into a maxim, in certain
quarters, that Religion, or Irreligion, is a matter
of no moment in the characters of men, and
that none, but a bigot, is affected by that distinction?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>It is true, the wiser, and, in every sense of
the word, better, part of the public have an
abhorrence of this profligacy. They profess,
and without doubt entertain, a respect for the
authority of their divine religion. Yet who
has not observed, that more than a few of these
reduce that authority to just nothing, and, in a
sort of philosophical delirium, are for setting
up their Reason, that is, their <i>own</i> authority,
in it’s stead?</p>

<p>Even we, of the Clergy, have we not some
need to be put in mind of <i>doing our first works</i>,
and of returning to <i>our first love</i><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>? Has not
the contagion of the times sicklied over the
complexion of even <i>our</i> zeal and charity? while
we neither repell the enemies of the faith with
that vigour, nor confirm the faithful themselves
with that vigilance, which did so much honour
to our predecessors in the sacred ministry.</p>

<p>But to come to plain <i>practical Religion</i>, as
evidenced in our churches, and houses, and in
the offices of common life.</p>

<p>How few are there, in comparison, who
make a conscience of serving God, either in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
public, or in private? Is there so much as the
air of piety in numberless families, even on
that day, which by God and man is set apart
for the duties of it? Nay, is not that day, I
had almost said, in preference to others, prophaned
by every sort of amusement and dissipation?
As if there was a full purpose to
shake off even that small appearance of religion,
which the Lord’s day has hitherto, and
but barely, kept up. So little do we retain of
that habitual seriousness, that awful sense of
God, and of our dependence upon him, in
which the essence of the religious character
consists!</p>

<p>2. And, if such be the state of religion
among us, who will wonder, that the <small>MORAL
VIRTUES</small>, which have no firm abode in the
Godless mind, are deserting us so fast? Who
can think it strange, that oaths have lost their
power? And that the most solemn engagements,
even those contracted at the altar itself,
are falling apace, or rather are <i>fallen</i> with many,
into contempt?</p>

<p>Our <i>natural</i> appetites, indeed, are impatient
for their respective gratifications; and the lower
classes of men, uneducated and undisciplined,
are, at all times, too generally enslaved by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
them. But an overflow of wealth, and, it’s
consequence, ingenious Luxury, has now made
our <i>fantastic</i> wants, as clamorous, as the natural;
and the rage, with which the objects of
them, or what we call polite and elegant pleasures
and accommodations, are pursued in the
higher ranks of life, discovers an impotency of
mind, equal to that of the lowest vulgar, and
more ruinous in its effects. For, whence is it,
else, that bankruptcies are so frequent? that
every species of fraud and rapine is hazarded?
that a lust for gaming is grown epidemical and
uncontroulable? that the ruin of noble and
opulent families surprizes nobody? that even
suicide is the crime of almost every day, nay
and justified, too, as well as committed?</p>

<p>If horrors, like these, admit of aggravation,
it is, that they meet us in a country, where the
religion of Jesus is taught in it’s purity, and,
as yet, is publicly professed; in a country, that
wants no means of knowing it’s duty, and,
among it’s other motives to the practice of it,
has one, as rare as it is valuable, I mean, The
best example in the highest place.</p>

<p>3. In this relaxed state of <i>private morals</i>, it
is easy to guess what must be the tone of our
<small>CIVIL</small> or <small>POLITICAL</small> virtues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<p>Vice is never so shameless, as when it pretends
to public spirit. Yet this effrontery is
so common, that it scandalizes nobody. If,
indeed, noise and clamour and violence; if an
affected tumour of words, breaking out in a
loud defiance of dignities; if intemperate invectives
against the most respected characters,
and a contempt of all that wears the face of
authority among us——were proofs of a just
concern for the common weal; there would be
no want of this virtue.</p>

<p>But who sees not, that true patriotism dares
not allow itself in these liberties? that, if, in
pursuit of a favourite object, it goes, occasionally,
some lengths, scarce justifiable itself,
it never fails, however, to stop at a certain
point, and to respect, at least, the firm immoveable
barriers of the Constitution? But
has such been the modesty of our times? Let
every one judge for himself. And, for the rest,
I wish it had not appeared of late, that such a
spirit of rapine and corruption prevails, both at
home and abroad, as threatens the subversion
of all our public interests;—a spirit! which
neither the vigilance of parliament, for the severity
of public justice, hath been able to
controul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>I <small>PASS RAPIDLY</small> over these things, and omit
a thousand others, that might be mentioned,
because I would rather suggest matter to your
own reflexions, than enlarge on so unwelcome
a subject, myself. Besides, I know what is
commonly thought of such representations.
Some will treat them, as decent words, on this
occasion; others, as charges much aggravated,
if not groundless; even, on many well-intentioned
men an old and oft-repeated complaint
will make, it is possible, but a slight impression.</p>

<p>Still, it is <i>our</i> duty to speak plainly, on such
a day, as this; and if we speak truly too, it is
very clear what must be the duty of our <i>hearers</i>.
Reason stands aghast at the sight of an “unprincipled,
immoral, incorrigible” publick: And
the word of God abounds in such threats and
denunciations, as must strike terror into the
heart of every Believer. And, although Repentance
may not ensure success in the great
contest, now depending, (for the All-wise Disposer
of events may see fit to decree otherwise);
yet the likeliest method we can take to procure
that success will be, by rendering ourselves
somewhat less unworthy of it, than, assuredly,
we now are. At all events, an amendment of
life will recommend us to the favour of God,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
and must therefore be useful, indeed is the only
thing that, in the end, can be truly so, to us.</p>

<p>Let us then (every one for himself) try what
Repentance can do, under this conviction of a
too general depravity, and in this hour of national
distress. One natural effect of it will
be, A readiness to submit ourselves to the authority
of Government in all those just measures,
which it may see fit to take in the present
emergency, and to give the utmost effect
to them by our entire agreement and unanimity.</p>

<p>And would to God, we had always been of
this mind!—But, let us, at length, resolve to
be so. Then may we hope, with the divine
blessing (which we have supplicated this day)
on his Majesty’s arms and councils, that this
unnatural Rebellion will be soon composed; the
just rights of the nation restored; and a way
opened for the re-establishment of <i>law</i> and <i>order</i>
in those miserably distracted provinces, which
have now learned, from experience, the just
value of both.</p>

<p>To conclude; a pious and Christian use of
the present occasion, in putting up our vows to
heaven for the return of the public tranquillity,
and in forsaking, every one of us, the error of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
our ways, will perfectly correspond to the views
of our most religious and gracious Sovereign;
who, in calling upon us to join with him in
this solemn fast, in the midst of his successes,
demonstrates, that his trust is not in his own
strength, but that of the Almighty; that He
regards this necessary chastisement of his undutiful
subjects as a matter of the deepest humiliation;
and that Victory itself but redoubles
his ardour to procure for us, and for all his
people, the blessings of Peace.</p>

<h2>SERMON, &amp;c.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hebrews</span>, xiii. 8.</h3>

<p><i>Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and
for ever.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">These</span> words, if considered with an eye to
the preceding verses, may mean, “That our
Lord Jesus Christ is always attentive to the
wants and distresses of his faithful followers,
and always at hand to relieve them:” Or, if
we connect them with the verse immediately
following, we may understand them as expressing
this proposition, “That the doctrine
of Jesus Christ is always one and the same,
independently of the wayward and changeable
fancies of men.” In either way, I say, the
words may be taken; and they do not necessarily
imply more than the one or the other of
these two senses, which the context will oblige
us to bestow upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>But the minds of the Apostles, full of the
greatest ideas, and swelling with the suggestions
of the holy Spirit, which, in no scanty measure,
was imparted to them, perpetually overflow,
as it were, the subject of their discourse, and
expatiate into other and larger views, than seem
necessary to the completion of the argument,
immediately presented to them.</p>

<p>This being the manner of the inspired writers,
it can be thought no forced or violent construction
of the text, to take it in the full extent
of the expression; which is so striking and
awful, as naturally to turn our thoughts towards
the contemplation of the three following particulars:</p>

<p>First, The ineffable glory of our Lord’s
<i>Person</i>;</p>

<p>Secondly, The immensity of the scheme of
<i>Redemption through his blood</i><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>; And</p>

<p>Lastly, The unchangeable nature of his
<i>Religion</i>.</p>

<p>In these several senses, it is truly and emphatically
said of Jesus Christ, That <i>he is the
same yesterday, to-day, and for ever</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>I. The transcendent dignity of our blessed
Lord’s <span class="smcap">Person</span> is expressed in these words.</p>

<p>For what less do they imply than a perfect
state of being, a proper eternity of existence?
Agreeably to what we read elsewhere, That <i>he
was in the beginning</i><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>—<i>before all things</i><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>—that
<i>he is Alpha and Omega, the first and the last</i><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>—that
<i>his throne is for ever and ever</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>—and <i>his
goings forth from everlasting</i><a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>: Nay, and suitably
to the very turn of phrase, which the Holy
Ghost employs in characterizing the Supreme
Majesty of Heaven, <i>I am Alpha and Omega,
the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord,
which is, and which was, and which is to come,
the Almighty</i><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>When Jesus Christ, therefore, is held out to
us in the text, as being <i>the same yesterday, to-day,
and for ever</i>, we may be allowed, or rather
we are required, to elevate our thoughts to the
utmost, and to conceive with inexpressible awe
and veneration <i>of that glory which he had with
the Father, before the world was</i><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>II. We are called upon by these words to
reflect on the constant, uniform tenour of that
amazing scheme of <span class="smcap">Redemption</span>, which was
planned before the ages, was unfolded by just
degrees, and was finally completed in <i>Christ
Jesus</i>; in this sense, likewise, so interesting to
us, <i>the</i> <small>SAME</small> <i>yesterday, to-day, and for ever</i>.</p>

<p><i>The works of the Lord</i>, says the Psalmist,
<i>are great, and sought out of all those that have
pleasure therein</i><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. But which of his works is
so stupendous, or carries the enraptured mind
to so high an original, as that which respects
the redemption by Christ Jesus? Man was
produced in time, and stationed on this earth at
the distance of no more years, than our chronology
easily reckons up. But who can go
back to that moment, when the Godhead sate
in council on <i>the dispensation of Grace</i> by the
Gospel? <i>On the mystery, which from the beginning
of the world hath been hid in God, who
created all things by Jesus Christ; to the intent
that</i>, in the fullness of time, <i>unto the principalities
and powers in heavenly places might be
known by the Church the manifold wisdom of
God, according to the eternal purpose which he
purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord</i><a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>? Inspired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
language itself labours, we see, in setting forth
the extent of this dispensation; in declaring
to us <i>what is the breadth, and length, and depth,
and height</i> of this scheme of divine wisdom,
<i>through the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge</i><a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Known unto God</i>, indeed, <i>are</i> <small>ALL</small> <i>his works
from the beginning</i><a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. But this great work of
love seems to have been ever present to him;
to have engaged and occupied, if we may presume
so to speak, the constant, the unremitting,
the unwearied attention of the divine
mind; and to have entered into all the counsels
of his providence, which he had formed for
the display of his glory, <i>through all ages, world
without end</i><a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.</p>

<p>Such is the idea which the Scriptures oblige
us to entertain of <i>the manifold wisdom</i> of God
in Christ Jesus: <i>manifold</i>, as it presents to us
the various evolutions of an eternal and infinitely
extended dispensation of Grace; but
<i>one and the same</i>, with regard to the end in
view, the redemption of a ruined world, and
to the conduct and completion of them all by
the means, and in the person, of the Redeemer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<p>What parts of this scheme lie out of the
verge of our world, and how much of it hath
respected, or may hereafter respect, other and
higher natures by far, than the sons of men, it
would be fruitless to inquire, as these deep
things of God have not been distinctly revealed
to us. Yet one thing deserves our notice,
That <i>the Angels themselves<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> desire to look into
this</i> scheme of salvation; and are surely some
way concerned in it, since it was designed to
comprehend, <i>and gather together in one, all
things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and
which are on earth, even in</i> <small>HIM</small><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<p>But conceive of the interest which celestial
beings have in Jesus Christ, as you will; there
can be no doubt, that he has been invariably
the end of all God’s revelations to mankind.
The history of Redemption is coæval with that
of the Globe itself, has run through every
stage of its existence, and will outlast its utmost
duration. The precious hope of a Redeemer
was the support of fallen man; the
theme of all the Patriarchs; the basis of all
the Covenants; the boast and exultation of all
the Prophets; and the desire of all nations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>Look round on the shifting scenes of glory,
which have been exhibited in the theatre of
this world; and see the success of mighty conquerors,
the policy of states, the destiny of
empires, depend on the secret purpose of God
in his son Jesus: before whom all the atchievements
and imaginations of men must bow
down, and to whose honour all the mysterious
workings of his providence are now, have hitherto
been, and will for ever be, directed.</p>

<p>Such is the uniform, immutable, everlasting
tenour of that dispensation, we call Christian;
the power and wisdom of God in <i>Jesus Christ,
the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever</i>. But</p>

<p>III. Lastly, these words express the unchangeable
nature and perpetual obligation of
Christianity, considered as a <i>Law of Religion</i>,
or <i>Rule of Life</i>, as well as a scheme of wisdom
and mercy unspeakable for the redemption of
mankind.</p>

<p>Salvation by the blood of Christ was the
eternal purpose of God, the ultimate end of
all his counsels. But, for the attainment of it,
He chose to reveal his will gradually by several
intermediate and preparatory communications.
Hence the divine Law, though still directed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
the same end, has been diversified, according
as the Legislator saw fit, <i>at sundry times, and
in divers manners, to speak in times past unto
the Fathers by the</i> <span class="smcap">Prophets</span>.</p>

<p>But now, at length, <i>He hath spoken to us by
his</i> <span class="smcap">Son</span>; whose word has become the standing
law of mankind; obligatory on all, to whom it
is made known, and unalterable by any authority,
or by any change of circumstances whatsoever.
The terms of salvation are irrevocably
fixed. They are proposed to all, and required
of all, without distinction of seasons or persons.
The everlasting Gospel is addressed to <i>all that
dwell on the earth; to every nation and kindred
and tongue and people</i><a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. The extent of it is
universal; and the obligation so indispensable,
that <i>if an Angel from Heaven preach any other
Gospel than that we have received</i>, he is to be
rejected by us; nay, an anathema rests upon
him<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. Since <i>the sound of the Gospel is gone
out into all the world</i><a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>, we are to listen to no
other. Nor is it to be modified to our expectations
or fancies. <i>We are complete in</i> <small>HIM</small>,
<i>which is the head of all principality and power</i><a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>;
even in <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, with regard to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
perpetuity and eternity of his Law, as well as in
the other senses before considered, <i>the</i> <small>SAME</small>
<i>yesterday, to-day, and for ever</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After this</span> explanation of the text, every
one sees with what force it applies to the occasion
of our present meeting. For surely
such a Religion, as that of Jesus, so divine in
its origin, so extensive in its views, and so
permanent in its obligations, deserves to be
propagated through the world; and justifies,
or rather demands, the utmost zeal of its professors
to spread it abroad among all nations.</p>

<p>And such is the end of this venerable Society;
instituted for the double purpose of
converting the Heathen, who sit in darkness
and the shadow of death, to the blessed hopes
of the Gospel; and of keeping up and promoting
in professed Christians that <i>faith</i>, which
they have already received, but, through indigence,
ignorance, or a vicious life, have suffered
to languish and die away, or have not,
at least, cultivated to any valuable purpose.</p>

<p>And can either of these objects be indifferent
to us? Be it but the <i>latter</i> of the two, it
must deeply affect a good and compassionate
mind. Where the want of instruction is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
extreme in those who bear the name of Christians,
and the means of obtaining it clearly
not within their power, there is no doubt that
both benevolence and piety call upon us to
administer what relief we properly can to their
pressing necessities.</p>

<p>But the <i>former</i>, I suppose, is the main object
of the Society: And if, on this occasion,
we may have leave to enlarge our ideas a little,
and to contemplate that object in the extent
to which it has been carried by the zeal not
of our’s only, but of other ancient and modern
missions, we shall find it above measure interesting
to all true believers in Jesus.</p>

<p>For look on the various wild and uncivilized
tribes of men, of whatever name or colour,
which our ambition, or avarice, or curiosity
has discovered, in the new or old world; and
say, if the sight of human nature in such
crying distress, in such sordid, disgraceful, and
more than brutal wretchedness, be not enough
to make us fly with ardour to their relief and
better accommodation.</p>

<p>To impart some ideas of order and civility
to their rude minds, is an effort of true generosity:
But, if we can find means at the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
time, or in consequence of such civility, to
infuse a sense of God and Religion, of the
virtues and hopes which spring out of faith in
Christ, and which open a scene of consolation
and glory to them, who but must regard this as
an act of the most sublime charity?</p>

<p>Indeed, the difficulties, the dangers, the distresses
of all sorts, which must be encountered
by the Christian Missionary, require a more
than ordinary degree of that virtue, and will
only be sustained by <i>him</i>, whom a fervent love
of Christ and the quickening graces of his
Spirit have anointed, as it were, and consecrated
to this arduous service. Then it is, that
we have seen the faithful minister of the word
go forth with the zeal of an Apostle, and the
constancy of a Martyr. We have seen him
forsake ease and affluence; a competency at
least, and the ordinary comforts of Society;
and, with the Gospel in his hand and his Saviour
in his heart, make his way through burning
deserts and the howling wilderness: braving
the rage of climates, and all the inconveniencies
of long and perilous voyages; submitting to
the drudgery of learning barbarous languages,
and to the disgust of complying with barbarous
manners; watching the dark suspicions, and
exposed to the capricious fury, of impotent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
savages; courting their offensive society, adopting
their loathsome customs, and assimilating
his very nature, almost, to their’s; in a word,
<i>enduring all things, becoming all things</i>, in the
patient hope of finding a way to their good
opinion, and of succeeding, finally, in his unwearied
endeavours to make the word of life
and salvation not unacceptable to them.</p>

<p>I confess, when I reflect on all these things,
I humble myself before such heroic virtue; or,
rather, I adore the grace of God in Christ
Jesus, which is able to produce such examples
of it in our degenerate world.</p>

<p>The power of Religion has, no doubt, appeared
in other instances; in <small>PENANCES</small>, suppose,
in <small>PILGRIMAGES</small>, in <small>CRUSADES</small>; and we
know in what light they are now regarded by
reasonable and judicious men.</p>

<p>But let not things so dissimilar be compared
together, much less confounded. Uncommanded,
useless, sanguinary zeal provokes your
contempt and abhorrence; and with reason:
Only remember, for pity’s sake, under what
circumstances of ignorance and barbarity the
provocation was given. But when the duty is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
clearly enjoined<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> by the Redeemer himself;
when no weapon is employed by the enterprizing
adventurer but that of the Spirit; when
the friendliest affections prompt his zeal; and
the object in view is eternal life; when, I say,
the authority is unquestionable, and the means
blameless; the motive so pure, and the end so
glorious—O! let not the hard heart of Infidelity
prophane such a virtue, as this, with the
disgraceful name of <i>fanaticism</i>, or <i>superstition</i>.</p>

<p>Nay, Candour, methinks, should be ready to
make allowance for some real defects or miscarriages,
which will ever attend the best performances
of mortal men. What though some
error in judgment, some impropriety of conduct,
some infirmity of temper, I had almost
said, some imbecillity of understanding, be
discernible in the zealous Missionary? Something,
nay much, may be overlooked, where so
much is endured for Christ’s sake. It is enough
that the word of the Cross is preached <i>in simplicity
and godly sincerity</i><a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. He, whose <i>strength
is made perfect in weakness</i><a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, will provide that
even the frailties of his servants contribute, in
the end, to the success of so good a cause, and
the display of his own glory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>Thus much I could not help saying on the
behalf, and in admiration, of a <span class="smcap">Charity</span>,
which intends so much benefit to the souls of
men, which brings out so many shining virtues
in its ministers, and reflects so much honour
on the Christian name. They that feel themselves
unworthy to be made the immediate instruments
of carrying on this great work of conversion
among savage tribes and infidel nations,
should bless God for the nobler gifts of zeal,
and resolution, and fortitude, which he has bestowed
on others; and should promote it by
such means as are in their power, by their countenance,
their liberality, their counsel; by a
strenuous endeavour, in this humbler way, to
spread the honour of their Saviour, and the
invaluable blessings of his Religion, to the ends
of the world.</p>

<p>Thus shall we make some amends for those
multiplied mischiefs, and, I doubt, injuries,
which our insatiable Commerce occasions; and
second the gracious designs of an all-wise
Providence, which brings good out of evil, and
turns to his own righteous ends even those
<small>VICES</small> which our boisterous passions produce,
and which He sees it not fit, in this our day of
trial, to prevent or restrain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>Lastly, Thus shall we act as becomes the
professors of that Religion, which is divine,
universal, perfect; in one word, the gift and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
the likeness of <span class="smcap">Him</span>, who is <small>THE SAME YESTERDAY,

<h3><span class="smcap">1 St. Peter</span>, ii. 16.</h3>

<p><i>As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak
of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Christianity</span>, while it provides, chiefly,
for the future interests of men, by no means
overlooks their present; but is, indeed, studious
to make its followers as happy in both worlds,
as they are capable of being.</p>

<p>As an instance of this beneficent purpose,
we may observe, that the religion of Jesus is
most friendly to the <small>CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES</small>
of mankind.</p>

<p>There is something in the constitution of our
nature, which leads men to expect, and even
claim, as much independence on the will and
caprice of each other, as the ends of society,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
and the form of government, under which they
live, will permit.</p>

<p>Agreeably to these instincts, or conclusions
of reason, call them which you will, the
Gospel, both in its genius and precepts, invites
its professors to the love and cultivation
of <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>. It allows the freedom of private
judgment, in which the essence of <i>religious</i>
liberty consists: And it indulges our natural
love of <i>civil</i> liberty, not only by giving an express
preference<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> to it, before a state of slavery,
when by just and lawful means we can obtain
it; but, also, by erecting our thoughts, and
giving us higher notions of the value and dignity
of human nature (now redeemed by so
immense a price, as the blood of the Lamb of
God), and consequently by representing a servile
condition as more degrading and dishonourable
to us, than, on the footing of mere
reason, we could have conceived.</p>

<p>But now this great indulgence of Heaven,
like every other, is liable to be misused; and
was, in fact, so misused even in the early
times, when this indulgence of the Gospel to
the natural feelings of men was, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
Gospel itself, first notified and declared. For
the zealot Jews, full of theocratic ideas, were
forward to conclude, that their Christian privileges
absolved them from obedience to <i>civil
government</i>: And the believing Gentiles (who
had not the Jewish prejudices to mislead them)
were yet unwilling to think that the Gospel
had not, at least, set them free from <i>domestic
slavery</i>; which was the too general condition
of those converts in their heathen state.</p>

<p>These notions, as they were not authorized
by Christianity (which made no immediate and
direct change in the politic and personal condition
of mankind), so, if they had not been
opposed and discountenanced, would have given
great scandal to the ruling powers in every
country, where the Christians resided, and have
very much obstructed the propagation of the
Christian faith.</p>

<p>The holy Spirit, therefore, to guard the rising
Church from these mischiefs, saw fit, by the
Apostle Peter, to admonish both the Jewish
and Gentile converts to conduct themselves as
<i>free men</i> indeed, so far as they were, or could
honestly contrive to become free (for that their
religion no way disallowed); but not as <i>misusing</i>
the liberty they had, or might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
(which every principle of their religion, as well
as prudence, forbad). <i>As free</i>, says he, <i>and
not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness</i>:
As if he had said, “Be careful to observe
a due mean in this matter: Maintain your just
liberties; yet so, as not to gratify your malignant
passions under pretence of discharging
that duty.” And the better to secure the observance
of this precept, he adds—<i>but as the
servants of God</i>—that is, “Remember ye are
so to employ your liberty as never to forget the
service ye owe to God; who, in the present
instance, commands you to <i>obey Magistrates</i>;
that is, to submit yourselves to the government,
under which ye live, <i>not only for wrath</i>,
for fear of punishment, <i>but for conscience sake</i>.”</p>

<p>And this caution, so guarded by religious as
well as moral considerations, was the more
important, because no word is so fascinating
to the common ear, as that of <i>Liberty</i>, while
the few only know what it means; and the
many, of all ranks, in all times, mistake it for
<i>licence</i>.</p>

<p>And well had it been if this warning voice
of the holy Apostle, which sunk deep into the
hearts of the first Christians, had continued to
make the same impression on the whole Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
world; which, unhappily, has contemned,
or at least neglected it, in almost all ages; but
never more remarkably, than in those disastrous
days, which the present solemnity calls upon
us to recollect and lament.</p>

<p>I. The great quarrel of the times I speak of,
was opened with the cry of <small>RELIGIOUS LIBERTY</small>;
not without reason, it must be confessed,
yet with an ill grace in the complainants;
who certainly would have denied to others
what they so peremptorily, and indeed with
too much petulance, demanded for themselves.</p>

<p>The source of this evil (to do justice to all
sides) is to be sought in the Reformation itself;
which, when it had succeeded in its great view
of cleansing Religion from the corruptions of
Popery, concluded that no man could have reason,
thenceforth, to dissent from the national
church; and that an universal conformity to its
discipline and doctrine was to be exacted. The
conclusion was natural enough in their situation;
and the benefit of such conformity, past
dispute. But it was not considered, that differences
<i>will</i> arise, many times, without reason;
and, when they do, that force is not the proper
way to compose them. This oversight continued
long, and had terrible effects. It kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
the Protestants of all denominations from entertaining
just ideas of <i>Toleration</i>; the <i>last</i>
great point of reformed religion which was
clearly understood, and perhaps the <i>only</i> one of
real moment in which the extraordinary persons,
whom Providence raised up to be the
conductors of <i>our</i> Reformation, were deficient.</p>

<p>In this state of things, it unfortunately happened
that the Reformation was suddenly
checked by the return of Popery, which forced
many pious and eminent men to take refuge in
the Protestant churches abroad; where they
grew enamoured of certain forms of church-government,
different from those that prevailed
at home; and which, on their subsequent return,
they fanatically strove to obtrude on
their brethren, and to erect, under the new
name of <span class="smcap">The Discipline</span>, on the ruins of the
established hierarchy. So unreasonable a pretension
naturally alarmed and exasperated those
who had power in their hands, and had their
prejudices too, not less violent than those by
which the <i>Puritans</i> (for that was the name they
went by) were possessed. The consequence
was what might be expected. A <i>toleration</i> for
their discipline out of the establishment, which
was all they should have aimed at, and to which
they had a right, would not have satisfied them;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
and their iniquitous claim of <i>Dominion</i> was
too naturally repaid by penal laws and compulsive
statutes: that is, one sort of tyranny was
repressed and counteracted by another. And
thus matters continued through several reigns;
till some more pressing claims of civil liberty,
mixing with these struggles for church-dominion,
overthrew, in the end, the ancient ecclesiastical
government; drove the bishops from
their sees, the liturgy from our churches, and
brought in the classical regimen, enforced, in
its turn, as the episcopal one had been, with
the rigours of persecution.</p>

<p>Still, the restless spirit of the times continuing,
or rather increasing, this new model
was forced to give may to another, which assumed
the more popular name of <i>Independency</i>;
under whose broad wing a thousand sects sprung
up, each more extravagant than the other,
till, in the end, all order in religious matters,
and religion itself, disappeared, under the prevailing
torrent of fanaticism and confusion.</p>

<p>Such is the brief, but just, account of the
religious factions of those days: from which
we collect how miserably the zealots for religious
liberty defeated their own aims; or rather
how wickedly they contended for power and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
libertinism, under the mask of liberty: An evil,
which could not have happened, had they paid
the least regard to the Apostle’s injunction of
<i>being free, but not as using their liberty for a
cloak of maliciousness</i>.</p>

<p>II. The claims of <small>CIVIL LIBERTY</small> (which
sprung up amid this rage of religious parties)
were better founded; were for a time carried
on more soberly; and, as was fitting, were, at
first, attended with better success.</p>

<p>The mixed form of the English government,
originally founded on the principles of liberty,
had, from many concurring causes, degenerated
into a kind of monarchical despotism, which
an unquestionably virtuous, but misinformed
and misguided Prince, was for moulding into a
regular system. Happily the growing light
and spirit of the times excited a general impatience
of that project; and produced a steady
and constitutional opposition to it. The distresses
of government aided the friends of liberty,
who managed their advantage so well as,
in process of time, to support their claims, redress
their grievances, establish their rights,
and, in a word, to reduce the Crown, from the
exorbitances it affected, within the ancient and
legal boundaries of the Constitution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>This the Patriots of that time effected; with
great advantage to their country, and with
singular honour to themselves. Nothing indeed
could have equalled their glory, had their
labours in the cause of liberty stopped there.
But, besides that some means employed by
them, in the prosecution of their best-intended
services, cannot be justified; the intention
itself of many of them, hitherto so pure, began
to grow corrupt; their fears and passions transported
them too far; their public ends degenerated
into selfish: having vindicated the constitution,
their own security, or some worse
motive, prompted them to make free with it,
that is, to commit the very fault they had so
justly resented at the hands of their Sovereign:
In a word, the patriots, in their turn, insulted
the Crown, and invaded the Constitution.</p>

<p>The particulars are well known. Ambitious
leaders arose, or the old leaders in the popular
cause turned ambitious. Unconstitutional
claims were made: unconstitutional schemes
were meditated: what before was self-defence
and sober policy, was, now, revenge and hate:
the nation grew delirious, and the civil war
followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p>The rest is recorded in the disgusting annals
of those times. Six desolating years brought
on the subversion of the monarchy; and (as if
the victors meant to insult the law itself), by I
know not what forms of mock-justice, the
bloody scene was wantonly closed with the
public arraignment, trial, condemnation, and
execution of the monarch.</p>

<p>The tragedy of this day was the last insolent
triumph of pretended liberty. What followed,
was the most avowed tyranny; upheld for a
while by force and great ability, but terminating
at length in wild and powerless anarchy.</p>

<p>Such, again, were the miserable consequences
of not observing the Apostle’s rule of <i>being
free, but not as using liberty for a cloak of maliciousness</i>.
Freedom was, first, justly sought
after, and happily obtained: It was, then,
made the cover of every selfish and malicious
passion, till the wearers of it were enabled to
throw it off, as an useless disguise; when barefaced
tyranny and licentious misrule were seen
to emerge from beneath this specious mantle of
public liberty.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Restoration</span>, which followed, redeemed
these nations from some part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
miseries, which their madness had brought on
themselves. But for the full establishment of
our civil and religious rights, we were finally
and chiefly indebted to the <span class="smcap">Revolution</span>.</p>

<p>From that memorable æra, we became, in
every sense of the word, a free people. Conscience
was secured in the exercise of its just
rights by a legal toleration: and the civil constitution
was restored to its integrity.</p>

<p>III. Such are the observations, which the
sad story of the times we have been reviewing
obviously suggests to us. And now let us
pause a little: And having before us what the
nation so long suffered, and what it so late acquired;
that is, the horrors of fanatical tyranny
on the one hand, and the blessings of established
order and freedom on the other; let us inquire
dispassionately what improvements we have
made of both. Have the black pages of our
annals given us a just abhorrence of the principles
and practices, which brought that cloud
over them? And have the bright ones, which
so happily at length succeeded, affected our
hearts and lives, as, in all reasonable expectation,
they ought? In particular (to keep
the momentous admonition of my text in full
view) has the most perfect <small>LIBERTY</small>, civil and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
religious, been acknowledged with that thankfulness
it calls for, or been enjoyed with that
sobriety which so inestimable a gift of Heaven
should naturally inspire?</p>

<p>1. To begin with <small>RELIGIOUS</small> liberty.</p>

<p>Has this great privilege, so rightfully belonging
to us, as men, as Protestants, and as
Christians, which so many ages had panted
after, and the last so happily obtained, Has this
invaluable acquisition been employed by us to
the promotion of its proper ends, the cultivation
of just inquiry, and manly piety? On
the contrary, has not the right of private judgment
been abused to the worst of purposes;
the open profession of libertinism in principle,
and its consequent encouragement of all corruption
in practice? Has not religious liberty
been the <i>cloak</i>, under which revealed and even
natural religion has been insulted; infidelity,
and even atheism, avowed; and the most flagitious
tenets propagated among the people? In
a word, has not every species of what is called
<i>free-thinking</i>, <i>free-speaking</i>, and <i>free-writing</i>,
been carried to an extreme?</p>

<p>But to come to those who are not guilty of
these excesses; have <i>we</i> all of us made the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
proper use of the fostering liberty we enjoy in
religious matters? Have we been careful to
apply it to the purpose of dispassionately studying
the sacred scriptures; of investigating
their true sense with a due veneration for the
high authority they claim, and for the awful
subjects they set before us; and of maintaining
our conclusions from them with a becoming
modesty, which in such inquiries can hardly
be too great? Have we betrayed no symptoms
of bigotry even in disclaiming it? Are we
ready to indulge that candour to others, which
we so justly expect ourselves? And is the
public wisdom itself treated by those who speculate,
at their ease, under the most tolerant
establishment of Christianity that ever existed,
Has it been treated, I do not say, with a blind
submission (God forbid!) but with that decent
respect, which is surely due to it? In short,
have we, in our several situations and characters,
been careful to exert the full spirit of
Christianity, which, one is ready to think,
should naturally spring up from Christian liberty;
or, at least to observe that temper of
mutual forbearance, which should seem to be
an easy as well as reasonable duty, now that all
unjust restraints and provoking severities are
withdrawn?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p>2. Thus much for our religious liberties.
Have our <small>CIVIL</small>, on which we equally, and
with good reason, value ourselves, been secured
from all abuse? Have we that reverence of
just authority, not only as lodged in the persons
of inferior magistrates, or in the sacred
person of the supreme Magistrate, but as residing
in the <small>LAW</small> itself (in which the public
will, that is, the whole collective authority of
the State is, as it were, concentered)—Have
we, I say, that ingenuous and submissive respect
for this authority, which not only reason
and religion, but true policy, and every man’s
proper interest requires? Our boasted Constitution
itself, now so accurately defined and
generally understood, Does it meet with that
awful regard from us, which it justly deserves?
Are we anxious, that, of its several parts, each
should have its full play, without interfering
with any other? And are we sufficiently on
our guard against a spirit of innovation, which,
after all our experience, can have no probable
view of effecting much good, but may easily
do unforeseen and irreparable mischief? It is
true, in the less perfect forms of government,
alterations may not be so sensibly felt. But in
a Polity like our’s, so nicely and artificially
adjusted, and, like a well-constructed arch,
held together by the intimate relation and mutual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
pressure of its several parts, the removal
or even change of any one may loosen the connexion
of the rest, and, by disjointing the
whole fabrick, bring it unexpectedly on our
heads.</p>

<p>Let me, then, repeat the question.
Have we that religious reverence for the
Constitution which its value, its authority,
its compact and harmonious contexture, so
evidently demands? And, when it hath bestowed
upon us the blessings of civil liberty,
in as full measure as is perhaps consistent with
government itself, are we only solicitous to
preserve it pure, enjoy it thankfully, and transmit
it, unimpaired by hasty and hazardous experiments,
to the generations to come?</p>

<p>If to these, and other questions of the like
sort, we can answer to our satisfaction, it is
well. If we cannot, we should lay hold on the
present occasion of recollecting the miscarriages
and the miseries of past times, and of regulating
our conduct by the instructive lessons,
which they read to us. We shall see, in
every instance I have suggested to you, how
the abuse of religious and civil liberty kept
operating in those days, till it produced the
ruin and the loss of both—the <i>irreparable</i> loss,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
if it had not pleased a gracious Providence to
be much kinder to us than we deserved, or
had reason to expect.</p>

<p>Not to profit by this experience would be
inexcusable; especially, when the date of it is
so recent, and when this solemn day of humiliation
(for that purpose kept up by authority)
so affectingly reminds us of it. We cannot, if
we reflect on what it sets before us, but see in
the most convincing manner, that, to reap the
benefits of the best government, we must, ourselves,
be moderate and wise; and that <i>to use
our liberty for a cloak of maliciousness</i> is, at
once, the greatest impiety in those who profess
themselves <i>the servants of God</i>, and the greatest
folly in those who are, and would continue to
be, a <i>free</i> and happy people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reverend Brethren</span>,</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> having pleased God to call me to the care
of this large Diocese, I thought it became me
to take the first opportunity, which the established
course of Visitation afforded, of meeting
my brethren, the Clergy: that so we might
be the sooner acquainted with each other; and
that, by means of their prudent advice and
information, I might be the better enabled to
sustain the weighty office imposed upon me.</p>

<p>I may, hereafter, as occasion serves, be more
<i>particular</i> in my directions to you. At this
time, it will be sufficient to lay before you
some <i>general</i> considerations on our common
<small>PASTORAL DUTY</small>, and to animate myself and
you to a faithful discharge of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>When our blessed Lord and Master sent
forth his favoured servants to labour in that
ministry to which he had called them, he addressed
them in these memorable words—<i>I
have chosen and ordained you</i>, <small>THAT YE SHOULD
GO AND BRING FORTH FRUIT, AND THAT YOUR
FRUIT SHOULD REMAIN</small><a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>: “That ye may go
with this commission to plant my doctrine in
the world; and that, by your cultivation of it,
it may take such root as to bring forth a fruitful
harvest of believers, and continue to do so
through all ages.”</p>

<p>But what, then, is this <i>mature and perpetual
harvest</i>, which is here proposed to the Disciples,
as the end of their labours? Is it a harvest of
such believers, as shall barely give their name
to Christ? Certainly, not; but of such as
shall be found worthy of him. It is a harvest,
then, of <i>well-informed</i>, <i>pious</i>, and <i>righteous</i>,
believers. This is the precious everlasting <i>fruit</i>,
which it was entrusted to their office to produce:
and this fruit, the due discharge of their
office, under the blessing of God, makes them
<i>capable</i> of producing.</p>

<p>In these affecting words, then, of our divine
Master (the more affecting, because among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
last that were uttered by him) the <i>Apostles</i>,
first, and, after them, <i>all</i> succeeding ministers
of the Gospel, are called upon to bring forth,</p>

<p>1. The fruit of a <small>RIGHT FAITH</small> in their hearers;
as resulting from the soundness of their
doctrine. 2. The fruit of <small>PIETY</small> in their flocks;
in consequence of a diligent ministration in all
the offices of their sacred function. And, 3.
The fruit of <small>CHARITY</small> in their Christian brethren;
as springing out of their godly exhortations
and blameless examples.</p>

<p>Such, my reverend brethren, is the end for
which <small>WE</small> are <i>chosen and ordained</i> to serve in
the church of Christ. And though, in setting
this end before you, I shall but reflect your own
thoughts: yet, in doing this, I may be a no
unuseful, certainly, no ungrateful, remembrancer;
since it is the duty, the desire, and
the glory of us all, that we <i>bring forth fruit</i>,
and that <i>our fruit remain</i>.</p>

<p>I. The <small>FIRST</small> object of our ministry is, to
instruct our hearers in the <small>RIGHT FAITH</small>: and to
this end, we are required to <i>take heed to our
doctrine</i><a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>The Religion of Jesus claiming to be from
God, the <i>doctrines</i>, it delivers, are as well to be
believed, as its <i>precepts</i> to be observed. Thus,
a <i>dogmatic theology</i> becomes essential to Christianity;
its professors are equally bound
by a certain rule of <i>faith</i>, and of <i>manners</i>.</p>

<p>When the Scriptures of the New Testament
were made public, these were that Rule of
faith to the whole church of Christ. And, if
that Church had <i>agreed</i> in the interpretation of
them; or, if peace and charity could have consisted
with its <i>disagreement</i>, no other provision
for the maintenance of the faith had been
thought needful. But the Scriptures, like all
other writings, being liable to a different construction,
according to the different views and
capacities of uninspired men; and it being presently
found that such difference of construction
produced the most violent animosities
among Christians, while each sect pretended
a divine authority for its own fancies; no remedy
occurred for these disorders, but that the
<i>catholic</i> church should be held together by one
and the same confession, received and acknowledged
by all its ministers; or, when, afterwards,
this extensive project was found impracticable,
that those, who agreed in the same
interpretation of the sacred oracles, should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
allowed to separate from all others, and unite
themselves into one distinct and <i>subordinate</i>
church.</p>

<p>Thus, <i>Schism</i>, though it be always an evil,
and may be a crime, was introduced into the
church, and was even tolerated there, to prevent
other and greater evils, as well as crimes,
from flowing into it. For, though a diversity
of interpretation, in consequence of this liberty,
prevailed in <i>different</i> Christian communities,
which yet acknowledged the same common
Rule, <i>the Scriptures of God</i>; still, peace
was, by this means, preserved in <i>each</i> particular
community; and, by virtue of that general
principle of mutual toleration, which the expedient
itself implied, it was, or might be, in
good measure, preserved through <i>all the quarters</i>
of the Catholic church.</p>

<p>This, in one word, is the <span class="smcap">Origin</span>, and,
at the same time, the <span class="smcap">Justification</span>, of
Creeds and Confessions; which are only a bond
of union between the members of each Christian
society. For the purpose of them is not
to set up human decisions against the word of
God; but, by larger comments, and more explicit
declarations, in such points of doctrine
as have been differently apprehended, and much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
controverted, to express and ascertain the sense,
in which <small>THEY</small> interpret that word, who communicate
together in the same Church.</p>

<p>Thus the case stands, before the State gives
a preference to any particular Church. Thenceforth,
indeed, the State concurs with the
Church to enforce one common Confession, by
confining the emoluments, which it provides
for the encouragement of Religion, to the peculiar
doctrines of the favoured Church. This,
the State does, in <i>equity</i> towards that religious
society, with which it is now so closely connected:
it does it, too, in <i>prudence and good
policy</i>; because it conceives its own true interests
to be concerned in maintaining those
peculiar doctrines.</p>

<p>Thus, whether we regard the <i>Church</i>, before
it acquires the countenance of the State, as
intent on truth and orthodoxy, and only meditating
how best to preserve that truth in the
bosom of <i>peace</i>; or, whether we regard the
<i>State</i>, after it affords that countenance to the
Church, as studious to provide for its own great
object, <i>General Utility</i>, of which the preservation
of peace makes so considerable a part;
either way we understand why an agreement of
opinion is required in the appointed Guides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
and Teachers of Religion. But, as such agreement
cannot be expected, or not maintained,
where every Teacher is left to inculcate what
doctrines he thinks fit, hence some <i>common
formulary</i> of faith (not in opposition to that
delivered in the Scriptures, but by way of more
precise explanation of what is believed to be
its true meaning) is reasonably proposed to the
assent of those Guides and Teachers, before
they exercise their office in any particular
Christian society; as a <span class="smcap">Test</span> of their opinions;
and as a <span class="smcap">Rule</span>, by which, in subordination to
the general Rule of Christians, they undertake
to frame their public instructions.</p>

<p>This Confession, or formulary of faith, with
us, is <span class="smcap">the Thirty-nine Articles</span>: to which a
subscription is required from every candidate
of the Ministry. So that <span class="smcap">the Scripture</span>, interpreted
by <i>those articles</i>, is the proper rule of
doctrine, to every Minister of our Church.</p>

<p>It follows from what has been said, that
such, as cannot honestly assent to this formulary,
<i>must</i> (if they aspire to be public Teachers
of Religion) unite themselves with some other
<i>consentient</i> Church. This compulsion may,
sometimes, be a <i>hardship</i>; but can, in no case,
be an injury: or, if some may chuse to consider<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
it in the light of an <i>injury</i>, it is such an one as
must be suffered by individuals for the general
good of that Society, to which they belong.</p>

<p>It is nothing, that some object to these articles,
as <i>improper</i>, or <i>ill-drawn</i>. The Church
will judge for itself of these points. Societies
have surely the same right of private judgement
as Individuals; and, till they revoke a constitution,
it should, methinks, be presumed that
they see no cause to do it: just as it is very fitly
presumed, on the other hand, that such individuals,
as will not subscribe to this constitution,
cannot. But it is forgotten in this dispute,
that, although <i>truth</i> can only be on one
side, <i>good faith</i> may be on either.</p>

<p>Still, it may be said—“<i>These articles are
themselves liable to various interpretations</i>.”
Without doubt, they are: and so would any
other, which could be contrived. Yet, with
all the latitude of interpretation of which they
are capable, they still answer, in a good degree,
the main end of their appointment; as may
be seen from the animosity expressed by some
against them, as too strict. And, if we only
use <i>that</i> latitude, which the expression fairly
admits, and which the Church allows, they
will continue to answer the <i>great</i> end, hitherto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
effected by them, of preserving, among the
members of our Church, <i>an unity of the spirit
in the bond of peace</i>.</p>

<p>Such then is the fruit of a <i>right faith</i>, which
the ministers of our Church are required to
bring forth, by the <i>soundness of their doctrine</i>.</p>

<p>II. They are, in the next place, ordained to
produce the fruit of <span class="smcap">Piety</span>, in their several congregations,
by a faithful discharge of the sacred
offices, committed to them.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Liturgy</span> of the Church of England, in
which these offices are contained, is composed
with so much wisdom, and is animated, at the
time, with so true a spirit of piety, that
impartial men have generally agreed in the
commendation of it. That the <i>forms</i>, prescribed
by it, may be lawfully used, few at this time
of day will dispute. That <i>other</i> forms, more
complete and perfect, <i>may</i> be devised, <i>as</i> it is
not denied by <i>us</i>, who hold those forms, however
excellent, to be of human composition
only; <i>so</i>, that any such forms of greater perfection
are likely to be devised by those who
are the readiest to find fault with our Liturgy,
will hardly be expected by reasonable and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
knowing men. Much indeed, abundantly <i>too</i>
much, has been said and written on this subject.
Most of the defects, which some have
pretended to find in our Ritual, are purely imaginary:
the rest are certainly unimportant. So
that our concern is plainly to submit all deliberations
of this sort to the wisdom of the
Church itself; and, in the mean time, to give
all the effect, that depends on <i>us</i>, to the ministration
which it requires.</p>

<p>And to this end, it must be our duty to perform
the sacred offices with <i>regularity</i>, <i>decency</i>,
and <i>fervour</i>.</p>

<p>1. By <i>regularity</i>, I mean such an observance
of times and seasons, and of all the modes of
performance, as the Church hath thought fit to
prescribe. To this observance we are, indeed,
constrained by ecclesiastical penalties: but I
mention it as a fit testimony of respect to public
authority; and as the means of promoting
the true interests of Religion. For what is
<i>punctually</i> performed by the Minister will acquire
a due consideration with the people: and
the uniformity of <i>our</i> service will make the
attendance on religious offices more acceptable,
more convenient, more edifying to <i>them</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>2. Nor is it enough that these offices be performed
regularly, or according to stated rules:
they must also be performed <i>decently</i>, or with
due grace and propriety in the <i>manner</i> of discharging
them. For it is not, perhaps, enough
considered, how much a becoming celebration
of the sacred offices contributes to make men
delight in them, and profit by them: or, on
the contrary, how much any degree of negligence
in the <i>posture</i>, or of impropriety in the
<i>accent</i>, or indifference in the <i>air</i>, of the officiating
Minister, sinks the credit and authority
of his ministration, and deadens the attention
and devotion of his flock.</p>

<p>3. Still, this regular and decent discharge of
our duty, how useful soever, is but an <i>outward</i>
thing, and may, to a degree at least, be counterfeited
by those who are, otherwise, very
unfit to be employed in this service. To enliven,
to animate, to consecrate our ministry,
we must bring to it all the zeal of <i>internal</i> devotion;
such as is sober indeed, but real,
active, and habitual; such as flows from a religious
temper, and is wrought into the very
frame and constitution of our minds. For to
this end, more especially, are we set apart from
secular pursuits, to give ourselves up to reading,
to meditation, to all spiritual exercises;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
that so we may be thoroughly penetrated and
informed with pure affections and heavenly
dispositions. When these prevail in us, they
will naturally break forth and express themselves
in all our ministrations; they will be
seen and felt by all who partake of them, and,
by a kind of sympathy, will force the hearts of
others to <i>consent</i> with our own.</p>

<p>III. The <i>last</i> and best fruit we are to produce,
is the fruit of <span class="smcap">Charity</span>, or a good life, in
those committed to our charge; which is more
especially cultivated and matured by our <i>godly
exhortations</i>, and <i>blameless examples</i>.</p>

<p>1. As to our public exhortations, and discourses
from the Pulpit, such an audience as
this cannot want to be instructed in the manner
of preparing them. Permit me only to say,
“<i>That your Sermons cannot well be too plain;
and that they ought to be wholly Christian</i>.”</p>

<p>The word of God is designed for the edification
of all sorts and degrees among us, and
should be so dispensed as to reach the hearts
and understandings of all. And I need not
say to you who hear me, that to frame a discourse
in this manner, as it is the usefullest
way of preaching, so it will afford full scope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
and exercise for all the talents which the ablest
of us may possess.</p>

<p>But, further, you will allow me to observe,
that the topics and principles, on which we
form our discourses, must be <i>wholly Christian</i>.
I do not mean to exclude natural Reason from
our public exhortations, but to employ it in
giving force to those best and most efficacious
arguments for a good life, which the Gospel
supplies. I would only say, That we are not
to preach morality, in exclusion of Christianity:
for that would be to incur the guilt of <i>preaching
ourselves</i>, and not <i>Jesus Christ</i>.</p>

<p>The various motives to virtue and all goodness,
which may be drawn from the great doctrines
of the Christian Revelation, as they are
infinitely more persuasive and affecting than all
others; so they should be constantly and earnestly
impressed on our hearers. To live as
becometh the Gospel, is the duty of Christians:
and therefore to preach that Gospel must be
the proper duty of Christian Ministers.</p>

<p>For that <i>other</i> requisite of a <i>good example</i>,
the case is too plain to require more than one
word. Our blessed Master has told us, that
we are <i>the salt of the earth</i>: and we remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
what he pronounces of that salt, <i>when it hath
lost its savour</i>. This warning may suffice to
guard the minister of the word from gross vice
and immorality. But much more is expected
from him. He is to <i>excell</i> in all virtue, and in
such sort as to make it amiable in the eyes of
men. He is to take care, that even <i>his good be
not evil-spoken of</i>, and that <i>the ministry be not
blamed</i>. For there are certain decencies, which
must be ranked by us in the place of virtues.
To be wanting in <i>these</i>, is to scandalize the
brethren, and dishonour ourselves. Our profession
is so sacred, that even our Christian
liberty must be abridged on many occasions;
and we must deny ourselves an <i>innocent</i> amusement,
when we have reason to conclude that
others will take offence at it.</p>

<p>How far, and in what respects, this sacrifice
must be made to the decencies of our profession,
is a matter of great <i>prudence</i> and <i>charity</i>; and
can only be determined, in particular cases, by
an honest exertion of those <i>two principles</i>.</p>

<p>Ye have now, my reverend Brethren, presented
to you a brief sketch of our ministerial
duties. And our encouragement, for the performance
of them, is, That hereby <i>we shall
bring forth fruit</i>, and that <i>our fruit will remain</i>:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
that is, we shall be instrumental in producing a
<small>RIGHT FAITH</small>, a <small>PIOUS OBSERVANCE OF RELIGION</small>,
and a <small>TRULY CHRISTIAN LIFE</small>, in our several
charges and congregations; and we shall, likewise,
be the means of transmitting these blessings
to Posterity, and of perpetuating these
good fruits to the end of the world. Thus, that
which is the <i>end</i> of our ministry, is also the
reward of it. Nor will the recompence of our
labours end here. In saving others, by the
means now recommended, we shall assuredly
save ourselves. For, by giving this full proof
of our ministry, we shall be <i>sincere, and without
offence till the day of Christ; being filled with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
all the fruits of righteousness, which are by
Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God</i><a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.

<h2>A CHARGE, &amp;c.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Reverend Brethren</span>,</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">On</span> this first occasion of our meeting, you
will think it agreeable to the relation I have
the honour to bear to you, if I take leave to
remind you of such of your Clerical Duties as
tend more immediately to your own credit, and
to the good order of this Diocese: Not, as if
I suspected you of being, in any peculiar degree,
deficient in them; but as, from the general
state of the <i>present</i> times, and from the singular
importance of them at <i>all</i> times, these Duties
deserve to be frequently and earnestly recommended
to you.</p>

<p>The Clergy of the Reformed Church of
England have always distinguished themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
by the soundness of their learning, by the integrity
of their manners, and by a diligent discharge
of the pastoral office. But these virtues
could not have flourished so much and so long,
had it not been for the <small>PERSONAL RESIDENCE</small>
of the Clergy. Hence that leisure which enabled
them to excell in the best literature:
hence those truly clerical manners, unadulterated
by too free a commerce with the world:
and hence that punctuality in performing the
sacred offices, so edifying to the people, and,
from their being always upon the spot, so easy
to themselves.</p>

<p>Now this Residence, which the very institution
of Parishes supposes, and the Common
Law intends, has, from early times, been bound
upon us by ecclesiastical canons, and, from
the Reformation, also by express Statute. So
that, in the style of Law, and even in common
language, <i>Incumbent</i> is the proper name of
every Parochial Minister.</p>

<p>I know, indeed, what exceptions there are
to the Statute, and needs must be in a Constitution
like our’s, founded on a principle of
Imparity and Subordination. I know, too,
how many more exceptions must be made on
account of the poverty of very many Cures, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
the necessity there unfortunately is of having
several churches served by the same person.
Lastly, I do not forget that, in the case of ill
health, and doubtless in other cases that may
occur, there will sometimes be good reason for
the Incumbent to desire, and therefore for the
Ordinary to grant, an occasional suspension, or
relaxation, at least, of the general Rule. But,
when these cases are allowed for, no Clergyman,
who considers the nature of his office,
and the engagements he is under, or who respects
as he ought, either the esteem of others,
or the satisfaction of his own mind, will suffer
himself to solicit, or even to accept, an exemption
from Residence.</p>

<p>And even they, who have to plead the privilege
of the Statute, or can alledge any other
just and reasonable excuse, will endeavour to
compensate for their absence, <i>by</i> occasional
visits to their benefices; <i>by</i> diligent inquiries
into the conduct of their assistants; <i>by</i> acts of
benevolence, hospitality, and piety; in short,
<i>by</i> such means as testify a readiness to do all the
good they can under their circumstances, and
manifest a serious consideration of the duties
which, in some degree or other, are inseparable
from the Pastoral Care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>In short, the reason of the thing speaks so
strongly for the incumbency of Parochial Ministers,
that they, who have the best excuse to
make for themselves, will lament their absence,
and accept the leave granted to them with regret.
And the rest of the Clergy will not allow
themselves to desert their charge, and forfeit
the dignity and almost the use of their destination,
for such slight and frivolous reasons as
can neither satisfy themselves nor others: for
the convenience, suppose, of living in a better
air or neighbourhood; of seeing a little more,
or, what is called, <i>better</i>, company; or sharing
in the advantages and amusements, be they
ever so innocent, of the larger and more populous
towns.</p>

<p>Pretences of this sort are nothing, when they
come in competition <i>with</i> the decency and utility
of being where we ought to be, and among
those whom we ought to serve; <i>with</i> the obligation
that lies upon us to make ourselves acquainted
with the spiritual and temporal wants
of our people, and, as far as we can, to relieve
them; <i>with</i> the precious opportunities, which
a personal residence affords, of knowing their
characters, and of suiting our publick and private
applications to them; <i>of</i> watching over
their lives, and contributing to reform or improve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
them; <i>of</i> guarding them against the attempts
of those who lie in wait to pervert their
minds, and indispose them to our Communion;
<i>with</i> the heart-felt satisfaction of being beloved
by our flocks, or of meriting, at least, to be so;
of knowing, in short, that we discharge our
duty towards them; and, while we approve
ourselves faithful ministers of the Church in
which we serve, are promoting the noblest ends
which a mortal can propose to himself, The
salvation of souls, and the honour and interest
of our divine Religion.</p>

<p>These considerations are so animating, that
they cannot but make a deep impression upon
every serious mind; and are so obvious at the
same time, that just to have mentioned them
to you must be quite sufficient.</p>

<p>I return, therefore, to the duty of those who,
on several accounts, may very reasonably excuse
themselves from a constant personal residence.
And with regard to such of you as
may be in this situation, I must,</p>

<p>II. In the second place, recommend it to
you, in most particular manner, that you be
careful in looking out for proper persons to
supply your place, and that you faithfully co-operate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
with me in appointing none but <i>regular</i>,
<i>well-qualified</i>, and <i>exemplary Curates</i>.</p>

<p>By <small>REGULAR</small> Curates, I mean such as lie
under no legal disabilities, and have received
episcopal ordination. You will perhaps think
it strange that these cautions should be thought
necessary. But in our licentious times there
are those who will presume to offer themselves
to you to be employed as Curates, although
they have incurred the public censure of their
superiors, or have not perhaps been admitted
into holy Orders. You will be careful, therefore,
before you allow any one to officiate for
you, though for a short time, and on a pressing
occasion, to inform yourself of his general character,
and to inspect his Letters of Orders.</p>

<p>But, if you mean to take him for your settled
Curate, you must do a great deal more. You
must send him with a <i>Title</i> and <i>Testimonial</i> to
be examined and allowed by me. And then I
shall have it in my power, not only to prevent
your being imposed upon by <i>irregular</i> persons,
but to see that you take for your assistants only
such as are in all respects <small>WELL QUALIFIED</small>:
including under this term <i>a competent degree of
knowledge for the service of the Cure to which
they are nominated; a good report of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
moral and religious conduct by credible and respectable
witnesses; and a willing conformity
to the discipline and doctrine of the Church of
England</i>.</p>

<p>With these qualifications, it is to be presumed
that your Curates will represent you
not unworthily, and will instruct and edify
your people as you yourselves would endeavour
to do, if you lived amongst them. And the
rather, as both you and I are concerned <i>to take
care, as much as possible, that whosoever is admitted
to serve any Cure</i> <small>DO RESIDE IN THE
PARISH WHERE HE IS TO SERVE</small>: <i>especially in
livings that are able to support a resident Curate;
and, where that cannot be done, that he do
reside at least</i> <small>SO NEAR TO THE PLACE</small>, <i>that he
may conveniently perform all the duties both in
the Church and Parish</i><a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

<p>Still, it is not enough that an officiating Minister,
whether principal or substitute, be of no
ill fame, and under no disability, nay that he
possess the <i>qualifications</i> and the <i>means</i> of discharging
his duty. It is further expected of
all who are commissioned to minister in holy
things, and therefore of Curates as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
others, that they execute their important trusts
with fidelity and zeal, that they be <small>EXEMPLARY</small>
in their whole conduct and conversation.</p>

<p>To merit the application of this term to himself,
a Clergyman will not only perform the
duties of his Church with becoming seriousness,
and with exact punctuality, but he will
be ready at fit seasons to advise or exhort, to
comfort or rebuke, as occasion requires, such
of his parishioners, whether in sickness or
health, as may stand in need of his charitable
assistance. He will spend much of his leisure
in reading and meditation, particularly in
the study of the sacred Scriptures, that he
may adorn and purify his mind, and qualify
himself the better for his spiritual ministrations.
He will even take care that his very amusements
be inoffensive, and not pursued with an
eagerness or constancy that may give occasion
for censure or misconstruction. He will be so
far from drawing upon himself the imputation
of any gross vice (which it would be dreadful
for a minister of the Gospel to deserve), that
he will not be suspected of levity or dissipation;
<i>but</i>, as the Canon directs, <i>will always be doing
the things which shall appertain to honesty, and
endeavouring to profit the Church of God; having
always in mind that the ministers of religion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
ought to excell all others in purity of life, and
should be examples to the people of good and
Christian living</i><a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>

<p>Such is the conduct which the Church requires
of those whom you employ in the care
of your parishes. I hope therefore I shall not
be thought too severe, if I give a particular attention
to the appointing and licensing of Curates,
and if I expect of the beneficed Clergy
that they chearfully and heartily concur with
me in this necessary circumspection.</p>

<p>To this end, and that the Church may be
served with reputable and useful ministers, I
must,</p>

<p>III. Further make it my earnest request
(and this is the <i>last</i> particular I have at present
to give in charge to you), that you take especial
care <i>what persons you recommend to me on
all occasions</i>.</p>

<p>It is my duty, and if it were not, it would
be my inclination, to rely much on your advice
in all things; much more, to lay the greatest
stress on your opinion and sentiments, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
presented to me under your hands in the solemn
way of a Testimonial. No consideration,
therefore, I hope will ever prevail with you,
no bias of acquaintance, neighbourhood, civility,
or compassion (for I shall never suspect
my brethren of any worse motive), to give the
credit of your testimony to any person whatever
that is unworthy of it, whether for the
purpose of obtaining holy Orders, or my License
to a Cure, or Institution to a Benefice.
The most scrupulous good faith must be observed
in all these cases; or it will be impossible
for me to prevent those scandals, which an unqualified
Clergy will be sure to give to the world,
and the infinite mischiefs they do to Religion.</p>

<p>Whenever you set your hand to a testimonial,
consider, I beseech you, that the honour of the
Church is concerned in what you are doing;
that the edification of the people, the integrity
of their lives and purity of their faith, the salvation,
in short, of their souls, depends on your
signature. When such momentous interests as
these are at stake, inattention is something
worse than <i>neglect</i>, and the easiness of good-nature
the greatest <i>cruelty</i>.</p>

<p>And now, my reverend brethren, by observing
these few plain directions—by residing on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
your benefices when you can, and by improving
that residence to its proper uses—or, when
you cannot reside yourselves, by employing
only resident and respectable Curates—and,
lastly, by a scrupulous use of your credit with
me in recommending none but fit persons for
the several departments of the Ministry.—By
complying, I say, with my earnest request, in
these several instances, you will render the government
of this Diocese easy and pleasant to
me. I reckon so much on your kindness to
me as to believe that <i>this</i> consideration will be
some inducement to you. But there are <i>others</i>
of more importance. For you will consult your
<i>own</i> honour, and that of your <i>Order</i>: You
will rejoice the hearts of your <i>friends</i>, and stop
the mouths of your <i>enemies</i>.</p>

<p>I said, <i>of your enemies</i>; for enemies you will
always have, so long as there are bad men.
And, while we endeavour to lessen the number
of these, it should be our utmost care that none
but <i>such</i> be ill-affected towards us. God forbid
that the friends of virtue and religion should
have so much as a pretence to speak or think
ill of us! They cannot have this pretence, but
through our own fault. Be we therefore strictly
observant of our duty: Let us be seen, where
the world will naturally look for us, in our proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
places, intent on our proper business; and acting
in our proper characters; and we shall infallibly
secure the esteem of <i>good</i> men, and till it
please God to touch and convert their hearts,
we may defy the malice of <i>bad</i> ones.</p>

<p>The truth is, my reverend brethren, it depends
very much on ourselves, whether the
world shall conceive well or ill of us. Licentious
and unbelieving as that world is, a learned and
prudent and pious Clergyman will force respect
from it. The more it may be inclined to blame,
the greater must be our diligence and circumspection.
And to animate myself and you to
this care, is the whole end and purpose of this
friendly address to you.</p>

<p>It only remains that <i>I pray</i>, with the holy
Apostle, <i>that we may abound in knowledge and in
all judgment; that we may approve things that
are excellent; that we may be sincere and without
offence till the day of Christ; being filled with
the fruits of righteousness, which are by Him
to the glory and praise of God</i><a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.</p>

<p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the
love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy
Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reverend Brethren</span>,</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Without</span> the use of Reason in Religion,
we are liable to be imposed upon by others.
With the immoderate or indiscreet use of it,
we impose upon ourselves. Both extremes are
to be carefully avoided: but the <i>latter</i>, being
that into which we are most in danger of falling
in these times, will possibly deserve your first
and principal attention.</p>

<p>Indeed the great Apostle of the Gentiles,
foreseeing the mischiefs which the pride of
human reason would produce in the Church of
Christ, gave a timely warning to the Roman
converts, <i>not to be wise in their own conceits</i><a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
And whoever considers the history of the
Church from that time to this, will find that
nothing has been so injurious to it as the affectation
of being wise <i>above</i>, or <i>beside</i>, what is
written; I mean, in opposing our own sense of
things to the authority of Scripture, or (which is
the commoner, because something the modester
way of the two) in forcing it out of the sacred
text by a licentious interpretation. In either
way, we idolize our own understandings; and
are guilty of great irreverence towards the word
of God.</p>

<p>It infinitely concerns the preachers of the
Gospel to stand clear of these imputations; and
therefore it may not be unsuitable to the occasion
of our present meeting, if I set before
you what I take to be the whole office of
REASON on the subject of revealed Religion;
what it has to do, and what it should forbear to
attempt; how far it may and should go, and
where it ought to stop; and lastly, how important
it is for a Christian teacher, and indeed
for every Christian man, to confine his curiosity
within those bounds.</p>

<p>I. The first and principal office of Reason
on this subject is to see whether Christianity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
be a divine Religion; in other words, whether
the Scriptures, especially those of the New
Testament, which contain the religion of Christians,
be written by inspiration, or have no
higher authority than the compositions of mere
fallible men.</p>

<p>Now, for this purpose, you will collect and
examine the numerous proofs, <i>external</i> and <i>internal</i>,
which have been alledged as the proper
grounds of assent to the truth of Christianity:
The proof <small>EXTERNAL</small>; first, from <i>Prophecy</i>, involving
in it an incredible number of probabilities,
some less striking than others, but all of
them of some moment in your deliberation; secondly,
from <i>Miracles</i>, said to have been purposely
wrought to attest the truth of Christianity;
recorded by persons of the best character,
who themselves performed there miracles,
or saw them performed, or had received
the accounts of them immediately from the
workers and eye-witnesses of them; and not
questioned, as far as we know, by any persons
of that time, or for some ages afterwards. In
the next place, you will consider the <small>INTERNAL
PROOF</small>, from the history and genius, from
the claims and views and pretensions of this
Religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>Under this <i>last</i> head, you will particularly
attend to the promises said to have been made
by Jesus to his disciples; and to the manner
in which those promises appear to have been
made good: the promise of inspiration to the
Apostles, and the evidence they afterwards
gave of their being actually so inspired.</p>

<p>Above all, you will carefully inspect those
books which contain the account of these and
other momentous things, as well as the doctrines
of Christianity itself; and you will see
whether the <i>facts</i> they relate be, any of them,
contradicted by authentick history, or the <i>doctrines</i>
they deliver be repugnant to the first and
clearest principles of human knowledge. You
will next inquire whether these books, containing
nothing but what is credibly or supposeably
true, were indeed written by the persons
whose names they bear, and not by persons
of later times, or by persons of that time,
whose authority is more questionable. You
will, further, consider what <i>degree</i> of inspiration
these writings claim to themselves, and whether
their claims have, in any instance, been
discredited and confuted. You will, lastly,
take into your account the <i>event</i> of things, and
will reflect how far the success of so great an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
undertaking has corresponded to the supposition
of its having been divinely directed; if,
in short, you can any way account for what
you know and see to be clear and evident <i>fact</i>
on any other supposition.</p>

<p>Such, I think, is the outline of what must be
thought the duty of a reasonable inquirer into
the pretensions of Christianity. To fill up this
sketch would require a volume: but you see
from these hints that here is room enough for
the exercise of the understanding, for the full
display, indeed, of its best faculties. If Christianity,
which invites, will stand the test of this
inquiry, you cannot complain that Reason has
not enough to do, or that your reception of it,
as a divine revelation, is not founded on reason.
Only, let me caution you against coming
hastily to a conclusion from a slight or summary
view of the particulars here mentioned.
You must have the patience to evolve them
all; to weigh the moment of each taken separately,
and to decide at length on the united
force of these arguments, when brought to bear
on the <i>single</i> point to which you apply them,
the <small>DIVINE AUTHORITY</small> of your religion.</p>

<p>To grasp all these considerations in one view
will require the utmost effort of the strongest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
mind: And, when you have done this, you
will remember that very much (so widely
extended and so numerous are the presumptions
on this subject) has probably, nay, has
certainly, escaped your best attention.</p>

<p>However, on these grounds, I will now suppose
that a serious man, who would be, and is
qualified to be, a believer on conviction, has
fully satisfied himself that Christianity is true,
and that the Scriptures, in which the whole
of that religion is contained, are of divine
authority.</p>

<p>II. A second and very momentous use of
Reason will then be, To scrutinize these Scriptures
themselves, now admitted to be divine;
that is, to investigate their true sense and
meaning. For, whatever their authority be, as
they were written for the use of men, they must
be studied, and can only be understood, as
other writings are, by applying to them the
usual and approved rules of human criticism.</p>

<p>I have already supposed, that you have
seen enough of these Scriptures to be satisfied
of their containing no contradictions to the
clear intuitive principles of human knowledge.
For this satisfaction must precede the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
conclusion, that the Scriptures are divinely revealed;
all truth being consistent with itself,
and it being impossible that any evidence for
the truth of revelation should be stronger than
that of Intuition. Still, it remains to inquire
of doctrines taught in these books, and apparently,
as to the general sense of them, not inadmissible,
what is their precise and accurate
interpretation.</p>

<p>And here, besides the use of languages, antiquities,
history, and such other helps as are
necessary to the right understanding of all ancient
books, you will have ample scope for the
exercise of your sagacity in studying the character
of the sacred writers, the genius and
views of each, with the peculiarities of their
style and method; in tracing the connexion of
their ideas, the pertinence and coherence of
their reasonings; in comparing the same writer
with himself, or different writers with each
other; in explaining the briefer and darker passages
by what is delivered more at large and
more perspicuously elsewhere; in apprehending
the harmony of their general scheme, and
the consistency of what they teach on any particular
subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>In all these ways, and if there be any other,
your Reason may be and should be employed
with all the attention of which ye are capable.
And when this task is now performed, and you
have settled it in your own minds what the
true genuine doctrines of Christianity are;
what our religion teaches of divine things, and
what it prescribes to us in moral matters;
What more remains to be done? Clearly, but
this—To <small>BELIEVE, AND TO LIVE</small>, according to
its direction.</p>

<p>But, instead of acquiescing in this natural
and just conclusion, the curiosity of the human
mind is ready to engage us in new and endless
labours. “<i>The wise in their own conceits</i> will
examine this Religion, and see if it be <small>REASONABLE</small>:
for surely nothing can proceed from
Heaven but the purest and brightest reason.”</p>

<p>Here, <i>first</i>, they perplex themselves and
others, by the use of an ambiguous term: for,
by <i>reasonable</i> is meant, either what is <i>not contrary</i>
to the clearest principles of reason, or
what is <i>clearly explicable</i>, in all respects, by
those principles. In the <i>former</i> sense, it must
be maintained that Christianity is a <i>reasonable</i>
Religion, and that no such contrariety to reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
is to be found in it. In the <i>latter</i> sense, it
may be true that Christianity is <i>not reasonable</i>,
I mean, that the reasons on which it is founded
are not always apparent to us: but then this
sense of the word is not pertinent to the case
in hand; and we may as well pretend that the
constitution of the natural world is <i>unreasonable</i>,
as that the system of Revelation is so,
because we are in the same ignorance, for the
most part, of the grounds and reasons on which
either fabrick is erected.</p>

<p>In the <i>next</i> place, supposing that, by intense
pains, and a greater sagacity than ordinary, we
are enabled to see, or guess at least, in some
instances, on what principles of reason the
great scheme of revelation or some of its doctrines
at least are founded, what do we get by
the discovery? Only, the addition of a little
speculative knowledge, which does not make
us at all <i>wiser</i> to salvation, than we were before,
and possibly not <i>so wise</i>; since <i>knowledge</i>, we
know, <i>puffeth up</i>, and <i>God giveth grace to the
humble</i>.</p>

<p>But, <i>lastly</i>, how do we arrive at this supposed
pre-eminence of wisdom? Generally, by
forcing the word of God to speak <i>our</i> sense of
it, and not his; by taking advantage of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
difficult texts, and by wresting many plain
ones; by making every thing bend, in short,
to our presumptuous fancies and preconceived
opinions.</p>

<p>You see, then, what my meaning is—“That
the <small>EVIDENCE</small> of Christianity, and not its
<i>rationale</i> (which, however justly conceived and
ably executed, cannot extend so far as curious
men require, because Reason itself is so limited);
I say then that the <i>evidence</i> of our
religion is the proper object of inquiry;” and
“that the <i>Scriptures</i> are to be admitted in that
sense which they obviously bear, on a fair unforced
construction of them, although that
sense appear strange to us, or be, perhaps, inexplicable;”
in a word, that the <small>AUTHORITY</small>
and <small>RIGHT INTERPRETATION</small> of Scripture are
what we ought to look after, and not the <small>REASONABLENESS</small>
of what it teaches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The truth</span> is (for I would now, in conclusion,
point out to you the mischievous <i>effects</i>
of this curious theology, which has so much
engaged the minds of Christians), the truth, I
say, is, That we know not what we do, when
we take heaven, as it were, to task, and examine
a confessedly divine Revelation by the
twilight of our Reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>1. One effect is (and can there be a more
dreadful one?) that this inquisitive humour,
thus leads directly to <i>Infidelity</i>,
and even <i>Atheism</i>. For <i>the wise in their own
conceits</i>, not being able to clear up many parts
of the divine dispensations, whether of nature
or grace, to their satisfaction, hastily conclude
that there <i>is</i> no fitness or wisdom, where they
<i>see</i> none, and make their inapprehension an
argument for their rejection of both. A perverse
conduct, indeed! but so common, that I
doubt whether there be any <i>other</i> so fruitful
source of irreligion. But</p>

<p>2. When the mischief does not proceed to
this extreme, still it is no small evil, that heresies
arise, and must for ever arise, among
believers themselves, from this way of subjecting
the word of God to the scrutiny of our
reason. For this faculty, being a different thing,
under the same name, in every pretender to it,
and, in its most improved state, being naturally
incapable, where the revelation itself is silent or
obscure, of deciding on what is fit and right in
the divine counsels, must needs lead to as
many different views and conclusions, as there
are capacities and fancies of curious men. And,
as every man’s reason is infallible to himself, because
his <i>own</i> reason, his zeal in the propagation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
of what he calls <i>truth</i>, will keep pace with his
presumption, till all is noise and dissonance
and discord; till peace and charity forsake the
world; till Religion herself disappears; and
what is left to usurp her name and place is only
an art, or rather a fit, of disputation. Then
consider</p>

<p>3. How immense a sacrifice we make to the
indulgence of a wanton curiosity. The Gospel
was given to fix our faith and regulate our
practice; to purify our hearts and lives, and to
<i>fill us with all joy and peace in believing</i>. Instead
of these substantial fruits, we reap I know
not what phantom of self-applause for our
ingenious speculations: we lose our precious
time in reasoning, when we should act, and
hardly ever come to an end of our reasonings:
we grope on in these dark and intricate paths
of inquiry, without ever attaining the heart-felt
joy of conviction: we are so intent on <i>trying</i>
all things, that we <i>hold fast</i> nothing: we spend
a great part of our lives, some of us our whole
lives, in suspense and doubt: and are so long
examining what our <i>faith</i> is, and whether it be
reasonable or no, that, with a divine directory
in our hands, we drop into our graves before
we come to a resolution of those questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

<p>These are the sad effects of this intemperate
wisdom, which therefore we shall do well to
exchange for a little modest piety. And such
has been uniformly the advice of the ablest and
wisest men, from the foundation of Christianity
down to this day. It would be endless to refer
you to particular instances in their writings.
Their sentiments on this subject are concisely
and forcibly expressed in the following passage
of as great a master of reason as hath appeared
in the Christian world since the revival of letters,
which I will therefore leave with you, and
would recommend to your most attentive consideration.</p>

<p>“Rationibus humanis scrutari divinæ naturæ
(and what he observes of the <i>divine nature</i>,
is equally true of the divine councils) cognitionem,
temeritas est: loqui de his, quæ nullis
verbis explicari queunt, dementis est: definire,
impietas est.” And again—“Satis est ad
consequendam salutem æternam, ea de Deo
credere, quæ palam ipse de se prodidit in sacris
literis, per selectos ad hoc viros, spiritu suo
afflatos; quæque post versans in terris ipse

<h2>A CHARGE, &amp;c.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Reverend Brethren</span>,</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> has been observed, that men of sense and
parts are not always on the side of Christianity:
And it is asked, how the unbelief of such men
can consist with the honour of that Religion?</p>

<p>We find this topic insisted upon, or insinuated
at least, with much complacency, in all
the free writings of these times. And some of
them, however offensive for their impiety, being
composed with vivacity, and delivered in a
popular style, gain more credit with unwary
readers than they deserve.</p>

<p>It behoves us to be on our guard against
those insinuations, and to prevent their having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
an effect upon others. It will not therefore be
unsuitable to the design of our meeting, if I
suggest to the younger part of you (for the
elder and more experienced have no need of
my instruction), if I expose in few words the
<i>folly</i> of inferring the falshood of religion from
the rejection of it by a few plausible or learned
men. And to give what I have to say the
greater weight with you, I shall deliver my
sentiments on the subject in a short comment
on a remarkable text of St. Paul; who has indeed
long ago obviated this prejudice, and fully
accounted for the supposed <i>fact</i>, without derogating
in any degree from the honour of our
divine Religion.</p>

<p>For no sooner was Christianity published to
the world, than it was opposed by all the wisdom
of that age, which was, in truth, distinguished
by its wisdom. But then it was <i>human</i>
wisdom only, confiding in itself, and wholly
unacquainted with <i>divine</i> wisdom. These were
often at variance, and sometimes irreconcileable
with each other. No wonder then, that <i>not
many wise men after the flesh</i>, as the Apostle
expresseth it, <i>were called</i>, i. e. converted to
Christianity, and that the wisdom of Revelation
was deemed <i>folly</i> (as it is in our days, and as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
always will be) by the idolaters of their own
<i>carnal</i> wisdom.</p>

<p>This early and popular prejudice, therefore,
against the religion of Jesus, the great Apostle
of the Gentiles found it expedient to remove.
And he does it effectually in that oracular sentence
delivered by him in the first Epistle to
the Corinthians, in these words;</p>

<p>“<i>The natural man receiveth not the things
of the spirit of God; for they are foolishness
unto him: neither can he know them; because
they are spiritually discerned<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.</i>”</p>

<p>The meaning of the words is clearly this:
“That no man can, by the force of his natural
understanding, however improved, discover the
doctrines of the Gospel; nor even relish them,
when they are proposed to him, so long as he
judges of them by the light of his reason only:
and that upon this account, <i>because</i> those doctrines
are solely derived from the wisdom of
God, which is superior to our wisdom; and
will even seem <i>foolishness</i> to such a man, <i>because</i>
those doctrines are not such as his natural
reason, or wisdom, would suggest to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>The text therefore, you see, consists of two
distinct <i>affirmations</i>, with a <i>reason</i> assigned for
each. 1. That the natural man receiveth not
the things of the spirit of God, <i>for</i> they are
foolishness unto him: and 2. that he cannot
know them, <i>because</i> they are spiritually discerned.</p>

<p>I begin with the <i>last</i> of these assertions.
I. That the natural man cannot <i>know</i>, i. e.
discover, the doctrines of the Gospel, is so clear,
that this assertion hardly requires any proof;
or, if it do, the reason given in the text is decisive—<i>because
they are spiritually discerned</i>—i. e.
because the knowledge of them is derived
from the spirit of God. For, how can
man’s understanding penetrate the secrets of
divine counsels? Or, as the Apostle himself
manages the argument much better, <i>What man
knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of
man which is in him? Even so, the things of
God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God.</i></p>

<p>II. His other assertion—<i>That the natural
man receiveth not the things of God</i>, i. e. is indisposed
to receive them—is more interesting
to us, and will require a larger illustration.
His reason for this assertion is, <i>For they are
foolishness unto him</i>. The reason is very general,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
and therefore obscure: for you ask how or
whence is it, <i>that those things are foolishness
unto him</i>?</p>

<p>I answer then, 1. because, <i>he could not
discover them</i>. It is argument enough, many
times, with the natural man, to reject any doctrine,
which his own sagacity was unable to
find out. For, taking for granted the all-sufficiency
of human reason, and that what is
knowable of divine things is within the reach
of his own faculties, he concludes at once that
such doctrines as he could not have discovered
are therefore false. If it be only in matters of
human science, a discovery, which very much
transcends the abilities of common inquirers,
is for that reason ill-received and slighted by
many persons. Much more may we suppose
this prejudice to be entertained against discoveries
which no human abilities whatever could
possibly have made.</p>

<p>But 2. a further reason why such things are
thought <i>foolish</i> by the natural man is, because
they are widely different from his notions and
apprehensions. He was not only unable to
<i>invent</i> them himself; but, when proposed to
him, he cannot see how they should merit his
regard, being so little suited, as they are, to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
previous conclusions of his own understanding.
Now this prejudice is of great extent; and is
almost natural to the pride of human reason.</p>

<p>For, supposing a divine Revelation to be
given at all, men form to themselves certain
notions of what it must needs be; and finding
that it does not correspond to those notions,
<i>they receive it not</i>, i. e. they conclude it to be
unreasonable.</p>

<p>Thus, <i>one</i> man imagines that the Gospel
could be only a republication of the law of
nature. He finds it is much more; and therefore,
without further search, infers its falshood.
<i>Another</i> man admits that the Gospel might be
an extraordinary scheme for the advancement
of human virtue and happiness: but then he
presumes that these ends could only, or would
best, be answered by a complete system of
moral truths, and by making the future happiness
of man depend upon moral practice
only. He understands that the Gospel proposes
to reform mankind by <i>faith</i>, and holds
out its rewards only to such as are actuated
by that principle. He rejects then a scheme
of religion which so little accords to his expectations.
A <i>third</i> person allows that <i>faith</i>
may be the proper object of reward, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
a faith in <i>God</i> only: to his surprize he perceives
that this faith is required to be in Jesus,
the son of God indeed, but the son of man too,
and in him <i>crucified</i>; that the Gospel supposes
mankind to have been under the curse of mortality,
and to be redeemed from it only in virtue
of Christ’s sacrifice on the cross. This strange
dispensation is nothing like that which he
should have planned himself: it is therefore
disbelieved by him.</p>

<p>Thus it appears how the <i>natural man</i> is disposed
to think unfavourably of the Gospel, because
its doctrines are not such as he should
previously have expected. But another and
more fatal prejudice misleads him. For</p>

<p>3. The things of the spirit seem <i>foolishness</i>
to the natural man, because on the strictest
inquiry he cannot perhaps find out the reasons
of them; and must admit them, many times,
upon trust, as we say, or, in the language of
Scripture, on a principle of <i>faith</i> only. This
experienced inability to search the deep things
of God hurts his pride most of all. That the
divine counsels are <i>beyond</i> his discovery, may
be true; that they should be <i>besides</i> his first
hasty expectations, may be digested: but that,
when discovered and considered, they should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
yet elude his grasp, and not submit to be comprehended
by his utmost capacity, this disgrace
is insupportable to him. Yet such are the
fundamental doctrines of the Christian Revelation.
“The forfeiture of life and immortality,
for all mankind, in consequence of one man’s
disobedience,” implies a degree of rigour in the
divine justice, of which he cannot understand
the reason. On the other hand, “The restoration
of that lost inheritance by the transcendent
humiliation of the Son of God,” is an abyss
of mercy which he can still less fathom. These
two principles, on which the whole scheme of
the Gospel turns, are not to be scanned by
human wisdom, and must be admitted on the
authority of the Revelation only. The natural
man finds his reason so much discountenanced
and abased by its fruitless efforts to penetrate
these mysteries, that he has no disposition to
<i>receive</i>, nay, he thinks the honour of his
understanding concerned in <i>rejecting</i>, such
doctrines.</p>

<p>4. The <i>fourth</i> and last reason I shall mention
(and but in one word) for the natural
man’s unfavourable sentiments of revealed religion,
is, That the wisdom of this scheme, so
far as it may be apprehended by us, can only
appear from considering the harmony of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
several parts, or, as St. Paul expresses it, by
<i>comparing spiritual things with spiritual</i><a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>; a
work of time and labour, which he is by no
means forward to undertake. So that, as, in
the former instances, his indisposition arose
from the <i>pride</i> of reason, it here springs from
its <i>laziness and inapplication</i>.</p>

<p>I omit other considerations, which indispose
men for the reception of the Gospel; such I
mean as arise from the perversity of the human
<i>will</i>; because I confine myself at present to
those only which respect the exercise of human
<i>Reason</i>. Now it has been shewn, that this
faculty, as it is commonly employed by those
who pride themselves most in it, is unpropitious
to Revelation—<i>because</i>, it cares not to admit
what it could not discover—<i>because</i>, it willingly
disbelieves what it did not expect—<i>because</i>,
it is given to reject what it cannot at all,
or cannot, at least, without much pains, comprehend.
So good reason had the Apostle for
asserting, that <i>the natural man receiveth not the
things of the spirit of God</i>!</p>

<p>Very much of what his been here observed of
<i>Unbelief</i>, might be applied to what is so prevalent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
in our days, and is termed <i>Socinianism</i>:
which, though it do not disown altogether the
authority of revealed religion, yet takes leave
to reduce it to a small matter, and to explain
away its peculiar doctrines, by a forced and irreverend
interpretation of Scripture. So that
the difference is only this: the <i>unbeliever</i> rejects
revelation in the gross, as wholly inconsistent
with <i>human</i> reason; the <i>Socinian</i> admits
so much of it as he can bend, or torture into
some conformity with his <i>own</i> reason.</p>

<p>But I have considered this species of <i>Unbelief</i>
on a former occasion.</p>

<p>At present, I conclude, on the authority of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
the text now explained and justified, that no
abilities whatsoever of the professed unbeliever
bring any the least discredit on Christianity,
because we know that the two inherent defects
of the natural man, <i>pride</i> and <i>indolence</i>, very
fully account for his unbelief, without supposing
any want of evidence or reasonableness in the
Christian Religion.</p>

<p>Let it then be no discredit to the Gospel,
that it requires <i>faith</i>, which is but another
term for <span class="smcap">Modesty</span>, in its professors. With this
amiable, and surely not unreasonable, turn of
mind, the sublimest understanding will not
scruple to receive the things of the spirit of
God; without it, the natural man cannot receive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
them: <i>for</i>, as the Apostle declares, and
this whole discourse testifies, <i>they are foolishness
unto him</i>.</p>

<h2>A CHARGE, &amp;c.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Reverend Brethren</span>,</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> Christian Church has, in no age, been
exempt from trials. The <i>faith and patience of
the Saints</i> have been successively exercised by
persecution, by heresies, by schisms, by superstition,
by fanaticism, by disguised or avowed
infidelity, and sometimes by downright atheism.</p>

<p>In the midst of these perpetual changes, the
duty of <small>US</small>, the Ministers of the Gospel, is one
and the same, <span class="smcap">To preach the word</span>, <i>in season
and out of season</i>, that is, whether the circumstances
of the time be favourable to us or not<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.</p>

<p>Concerning the <i>evidences</i> of the Gospel, or
the grounds on which our belief of it is founded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
I say no more at present, than that they have
been accurately considered, and set forth at
large, by ancient and modern writers, and are
in themselves abundantly satisfactory.</p>

<p>Taking for granted therefore, as we well may,
the divine authority of our holy Religion, there
can be no dispute about the obligation we are
under to <small>PREACH</small> it with diligence. But this
may be done in several <i>ways</i>: and it may be of
use to consider in <small>WHAT</small> way we shall most
effectually discharge that duty.</p>

<p>The Apostle delivers the whole secret in one
word, when he ordains—<span class="smcap">If any man speak,
let him speak as the oracles of God</span>. And
my present business will be to unfold the meaning
of this text, or rather to deduce the <i>consequences</i>
which naturally flow from it.</p>

<p>We are to <i>speak as the Oracles of God</i>: that
is, as men, who have it in charge to deliver
the will and word of God.</p>

<p>I. It follows then, <small>FIRST</small>, that we are to preach
the Gospel <small>SIMPLY AND PLAINLY</small>; i. e. 1. to deliver
Scripture truths, in opposition to merely
human tenets and positions: And 2. cogent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
and immediate inferences from those truths, in
exclusion of far-fetched and fanciful deductions.</p>

<p>1. Having a <i>message</i> to deliver, our business
is to report it with fidelity, and, as a message
coming from <i>God</i>, with all imaginable reverence.
Human ingenuity may be employed in other
compositions, but has no place here. Our own
fancies, and even persuasions, so far as they
rest on our own discovery, must be kept distinct
from revealed truths; and <i>the two sorts of
learning, philosophy and divinity</i> (as the wisest
man<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> of the last age advised), <i>are on no account
to be blended together</i>. The reason is, that
they stand on different foundations; the one,
on the use of our natural faculties, the other,
on supernatural illumination only. The latter
we call <i>Faith</i>; the former, <i>Opinion</i>, or, as it
may chance, <i>Knowledge</i>.</p>

<p>Some regard must be had to this distinction,
in discoursing on Christian <i>morals</i>, where Reason
can do most. But, as to articles of <i>faith</i>,
that is, the sum and substance of Christianity,
properly so called, the rule is to be observed
universally and inviolably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>2. It follows also, from our speaking as the
<i>oracles of God</i>, That we take great care how
we deviate from the sacred text, either in our
conclusions from it, or in our glosses upon it.
Our <i>conclusions</i>, unless immediate and direct,
and even countenanced by the inspired writers
themselves, may easily mislead us. For the
nature of the subject being not at all, or very
obscurely, known, we have but a dim view of
the truths necessarily connected with it. Great
caution, then, is in this respect necessary. It
is not less so, in <i>explaining</i> the sacred text. An
oracle of God should be delivered either in its
own words, or, at least, in words clearly, and
according to the best rules of interpretation,
explicatory of them. The contrary practice is
evidently irreverent, rash, and even prophane.
Had this circumspection in reasoning <i>from</i> revealed
truths, and in commenting <i>upon</i> them,
been strictly observed, all those heresies which
have corrupted, and still corrupt the faith, had
been prevented; and the Church of Christ had
happily enjoyed the great blessing we daily
pray for, <i>The unity of the spirit in the bond of
peace</i>.</p>

<p>II. It follows, in the next place, from our
being instructed to <i>speak as the Oracles of God</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
that we preach the truths of the Gospel <small>AUTHORITATIVELY</small>,
in exclusion of doubt or hesitation.</p>

<p>This is a consideration of great weight, and
puts a wide difference between the Christian
preacher and the theoretical discourser. When
weak men have no ground to stand upon in
their moral or religious enquiries but their own
industry and ingenuity, they may well suspect
the soundness of their conclusions, and had
need deliver them with distrust and caution.
But the word of God is unquestionable. What
is built upon it is certainly true. Our modesty
therefore suffers nothing from announcing
truths, so derived, with perfect assurance<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.</p>

<p>The advantage of this mode of preaching
must be obvious to every body. It was observed
by the Jews in the case of our Lord
himself; who, <i>speaking as the oracles of God</i>,
and as <i>God</i>, astonished his auditory, for that
<i>he taught them as one having authority, and not
as the Scribes</i><a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>: as having <i>authority</i>, because
he uttered nothing but infallible truth, which
he had received from God, and had even a right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
to deliver in his own name; and not as the
<i>Scribes</i>, who might indeed have spoken with
authority, if they had duly respected the Law
of Moses, which was the Law of God; but had
forfeited this advantage by the liberty they took
of mixing with it their own glosses and traditions<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.
A perpetual and awakening admonition to the
Christian preacher never to forget or betray his
high privilege of speaking with that tone of
authority which becomes his office, and commands
attention<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<p>This authoritative mode of preaching requires
that we carefully avoid, in our public discourses,
whatever has the air of <small>CONTROVERSY</small><a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. Our
business is to speak undoubted truths, not to
dispute about uncertain opinions. There are
many points, no doubt, relative to the Christian
Religion, besides the evidences of it, that may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
be properly inquired into, but not in our
Churches. We are to press <i>there</i> only what
we know to be true, and to press it <i>for that
reason</i>. Let such persons, then, as are curious
to pry into abstruse questions, have recourse to
the <i>Schools</i>, where such discussions are in their
place; or to <i>Books</i>, where they may be regaled
with this sort of entertainment to satiety. But
let them not carry this sceptical humour into
that <i>Chair</i>, whence oracles only should proceed.</p>

<p>The preacher will indeed say, his design is
to recommend and illustrate the truth by the
use of reason. It may be so: but let him remember,
that <i>the plainest truths lose much of
their weight when they are rarefied into subtleties</i><a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>;
and that what is readily admitted on the
authority of God’s word, becomes doubtful to
the common hearer, when we would prove it
by ingenious argumentation.</p>

<p>To compleat the character of a Christian
Preacher, it follows as a</p>

<p>III. Third inference from the Apostle’s rule
of <i>speaking as the oracles of God</i>, That he inculcate
his doctrine with <small>EARNESTNESS</small> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
<small>ZEAL</small>, and not with that indifference which is
usually found, and cannot be much wondered
at, in a teacher of his own inventions.</p>

<p>The Christian preacher should, I say, speak
with <i>earnestness</i>; that is, with a solicitous concern
to instruct and persuade, such as the
known truth of his doctrine warrants. This
earnestness must also be attended with <i>zeal</i>;
by which I mean nothing extravagant or fanatical;
but such a fervour of application as must
become an Instructor, who, besides the certainty,
knows the <i>moment</i> of what he utters.</p>

<p>These rules, it is true, were not unknown to
the ancient masters of Rhetoric, who told their
scholars, That to <i>convince</i>, and, much more, to
<i>persuade</i>, they were to speak with force and
warmth. But to do this, they were first to be
convinced and persuaded <i>themselves</i><a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>; which,
in their case, was no easy matter. For the
principles they went upon in their reasoning on
moral or religious matters, were frequently such
as they could not confide in; or the end they
aimed at, in applying to the passions, was in
no high degree interesting. In spite of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
rule, then, their discourses were often feeble
and unimpressive. It is quite otherwise with
the Christian preacher. For we are not recommending
a scheme of notions which we have
framed out of our <i>own heads</i>, or which we think
in some <i>small</i> degree conducive to the benefit
of our hearers. But we speak that which is
<i>indisputably</i> true; and inforce that which, out
of all question, concerns us most, “The salvation
of our souls, and eternal happiness.”
The coldest heart must be touched with sure
truths, and cannot impart them without vehemence.</p>

<p>I intimate, rather than express, my meaning
to you in few words; both because the time
allows me to do no more, and because I know
to whom these hints are addressed. For your
experience in the ministry of the word must
have prevented me in all I have <i>said</i>, and will
readily supply what I have <i>omitted</i> to say. I
assure myself, therefore, you will come with
me to this short conclusion, “That in our sermons
we should execute our commission with
<small>FIDELITY</small>, because it is <i>a commission</i>—in the
way of <small>AUTHORITY</small>, because it is a <i>divine</i> commission—and
lastly with <small>ZEAL</small>, as knowing the
<i>end</i> of our commission, and the infinite importance
of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<p>By this method of instruction (of which there
is no want of examples, or even <i>models</i>, in the
sermons of our best preachers<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>), by this Apostolic
mode of preaching, I say, we shall do
justice at once to our ministry and ourselves.
By speaking as <i>the oracles of God</i>, we shall
speak as we ought to speak; and we shall speak
with an energy that can rarely fail of effect.
We shall alarm the careless, instruct the ignorant,
confirm the weak, reclaim the perverse,
disconcert the wise, and silence the prophane.
We shall do this, and more, in the strength of
him who bade us <i>teach all nations</i>. And if we
teach them in the <i>way</i> which the Holy Spirit
enjoins, we may confidently expect the completion
of that gracious and animating promise—<span class="smcap">Lo,
I am with you always, even to the
end of the world</span><a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<h2>A CHARGE, &amp;c.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Reverend Brethren</span>,</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">I found</span> it necessary to defer my Visitation
of you somewhat longer than the usual time;
and have even now no pressing occasion to
trouble you with many words of advice or pastoral
exhortation.</p>

<p>For it is with great satisfaction I observe that,
in the present eventful crisis, the clergy in general,
and those in particular committed to my
charge, have zealously performed their duty in
those instances, that have chiefly called for their
exertions.</p>

<p>If the unprecedented <i>expences</i> of a just and
unavoidable war, against an enemy the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
outrageous that has ever alarmed Christendom,
have been felt by all; you have not only supported
your share of them with becoming alacrity,
but have done your utmost to infuse into
others the same ready obedience to the authority
of Government, and the same zeal for the
support and maintenance of our invaluable
Constitution.</p>

<p>If, again, for the punishment of our sins,
and to recall us to a due sense of sobriety and
piety, it has pleased God to visit us with <i>inclement
seasons</i>, and with the usual effect of them,
an extraordinary scarcity; you have every where
come forth to assist the poor out of your own,
not always affluent, incomes, and to solicit the
contributions of your parishioners with such
effect, as demonstrates <i>their</i> Christian temper,
as well as your own watchful care and diligence.</p>

<p>If, lastly, the <i>portentous libertinism</i> of the
times hath menaced the destruction of all civil
subordination, and even set at defiance all the
sacred ties of our holy Religion; you have not
been wanting, in your respective spheres, to
admonish the people of their duty; to revive
in them that veneration of God’s word and will,
which had been their support and safety in
former ages; and, agreeably to your solemn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
engagements at your Ordination, <i>to banish and
drive away all erroneous and strange doctrine</i>.</p>

<p>Having then so much to approve in your
conduct, little remains but to put you in mind
of those standing duties of our ministry, which
should never be omitted, and cannot be too
frequently recollected by us. And, of these,
one is so particularly called for in the present
moment, that I shall make it the subject of my
address to you.</p>

<p>I mean the duty of <i>Catechizing</i> the children
of your respective parishes. For, since the
enemies of all goodness are unwearied in their
endeavours to corrupt the young and unwary,
and to eradicate from their minds, as far as they
can, the first principles of religion and virtue,
the Christian minister cannot by any means so
effectually counteract their designs, as by a contrary
conduct. In other words, he must labour
incessantly to instruct the rising generation in
the first grounds and elements of Christianity,
contained in that excellent summary of faith
and practice, which the Church has enjoined to
be taught in its <span class="smcap">Catechism</span><a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<p>Now the uses of discharging this part of the
pastoral care with persevering industry are evidently
very great in respect, 1. To the Catechumens;
2. To the congregation present at
these exercises; And, 3. lastly, To the officiating
clergy themselves, the younger part of
them especially.</p>

<p>1. The Catechumens themselves cannot but
be greatly benefited by this regimen. For the
intention of the Church is, that, by the care of
their parents, and by means of those little
schools which are set up in all places, young
children should be taught, as soon as they are
able to attend to any thing, the Church Catechism.
And when, by some practice in this
discipline, they can repeat it well, they are to
be sent to the Minister of the parish, to be by
him publicly in the Church, at appointed seasons,
proved and examined before the Congregation.
This usage being continued for some
years, not only the responses to the interesting
questions in the Catechism must be deeply infixed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
in their memories, but something of the
sense and meaning of what they have learned,
will be gradually apprehended by them. So
that, by the time they appear before the Bishop
for Confirmation, if their respective masters
and teachers be not wanting to them, they
must have acquired a competent knowledge of
those important doctrines and precepts, which
are contained in it. Add to this, that, though
at the time of learning their Catechism their
knowledge of it be not considerable, yet it is of
the highest importance that it be learnt, and
that they can readily recite it. For, this foundation
being laid, they will, in maturer years,
and as their understandings open, the more
easily call to mind the rules of their duty, and
profit the more by any future instructions conveyed
to them in sermons, in the use of the
Liturgy, and otherwise.</p>

<p>Such will especially be the case, if the children
be accustomed, as they should be, to make
their answers distinctly and deliberately; and,
if the Minister intermix some short hints and
observations of his own, tending to make the
sense of those answers easy and familiar to them.
So much for the <i>Catechumens</i>; I observe,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<p>2. Further, that the whole <i>Congregation</i>
present at these exercises must be specially
edified by them.</p>

<p>The parents and friends of the catechized
children will, for obvious reasons, take a lively
interest in this public trial of their sufficiency.
They will listen themselves, more attentively
perhaps than they had ever done before, to the
<i>questions</i> and <i>answers</i>, and will enter further
into the drift and use of them. Nay, the whole
congregation will be put in mind of those fundamental
lessons of piety, which they had heretofore
learnt and repeated themselves, and be
now capable of reflecting more deeply upon
them. So that the old will carry away with
them much solid instruction, while the young
are training up to smaller degrees of it.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, then, of the benefit which
the Congregation would derive from this practice
of Catechising. But it would rise still
higher, if the Catechizers, besides interrogating
the children, and trying their memories, would
further take this opportunity of teaching all
present the momentous truths contained in this
breviary: I mean, if, during the season of Catechizing,
they would make the several parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
of the Catechism the subject of their Sermons.
And, to induce them the rather to do this,
I add,</p>

<p>3. Lastly, that, by exerting their industry
and talents in this way, the Clergy themselves
will derive no small use from this Catechetical
institution.</p>

<p>From the earliest times of Christianity, care
has been always taken to provide <i>Confessions</i>,
<i>Creeds</i>, and <i>Catechisms</i>, for the use of Converts
and the newly baptized. These were so contrived
as to contain in few words the fundamental
doctrines and commands of our Religion;
that so they night be easily understood
and remembered. Of these summaries, several
were drawn up by our Reformers; and, after
some changes and improvements, were reduced
at length into our present <i>Church Catechism</i>,
the most convenient and useful, because the
simplest and shortest, of all others.</p>

<p>All these, whether of earlier or later date,
are well known to the Clergy, and without
doubt are studied by them.</p>

<p>Besides, some of the most eminent of our
Divines have applied themselves particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
to write comments on these Catechisms, to
explain their meaning more fully, and to give
the most accurate expositions of them. These
expositors are so numerous, and so well
known, that I should scarce have mentioned the
names of any, if two of them, I mean Bishop
Pearson and Dr. Barrow, did not deserve to be
specially recommended to the student in Divinity,
for their superlative excellence.</p>

<p>Now then, by the use of our protestant Catechisms,
and of the many learned Commentators
upon them, the younger clergy, as well as
the more advanced, will have such abundant
materials before them, that they may, with no
great trouble, and with extraordinary benefit to
themselves, draw up a set of Sermons and Lectures
to accompany their Catechetical examinations.
I say with extraordinary benefit to
<i>themselves</i>; because it is certain that he who
takes due pains to teach others, teaches himself:
nor can the least prepared of our brethren
be at a loss to furnish his mind with a competent,
indeed a sufficient, degree of knowledge;
so as to instruct his congregation in all the
Articles of the Church Catechism, that is, in
all the necessary points of Christian faith and
practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

<p>In contemplation therefore of these benefits,
I recommend this mode of catechizing, and of
expounding the Catechism in occasional concomitant
discourses, to all my brethren very
particularly. The children will be trained up
for Confirmation in the knowledge of the first
principles of their religion; those of riper years
will be confirmed in what they had before
learnt; and the teachers of both will advance
their own skill and ability by this course of
theological study.</p>

<p>We shall be told perhaps by some, that this
way of catechizing is the way to fill the minds
of the Catechumens with <i>prejudices</i>. And,
without doubt, what is taught them in this
way is <i>pre-judged</i> for them. But by whom?
Not by weak, or unskilful, or dishonest persons;
but by men, the ablest, the most learned, and
the holiest, that have appeared in the Christian
world. Such doctrines, so derived, and, let
me add, clearly sanctioned by apostolic authority,
may surely deserve the name of <i>truths</i>,
and not of prejudices.</p>

<p>I am persuaded, therefore, that a Regimen,
so reasonable and so salutary, will recommend
itself to your special notice, as the likeliest
means of putting some stop to the licentious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
principles of the times. I will not suppose
that your zeal to do good can be, at such a
juncture, less operative, than that of others to
do mischief. In a word, by adapting a set of
clear, plain, earnest, and scriptural sermons to
the authorized office of catechetical examination,
we shall provide, at once, that our Congregations
be <i>instructed</i> in the right way; the
way which the wisdom of the Church prescribes;
and that we ourselves be duly qualified
to <i>impart</i> that instruction.</p>

<p>The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy
Ghost, be with you all. Amen<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.</p>

<p>The following Remarks were drawn up
within a few weeks after the publication of
Mr. Weston’s Book; but without any intention
of printing them at that time, when it was
conceived not unlikely that some more elaborate
Answer might come out. But nothing of
that kind appearing, and it being now no longer
probable that there is in fact any such design,
the Author has been induced to review his
papers, and to give them, with some small additions
and alterations, to the Public. How
far that <i>Public</i> will esteem itself obliged to him
for having suppressed them thus long, he presumes
not to say; but believes himself well
intitled to the thanks of the learned <i>Inquirer</i>,
as having <i>still</i> this merit, that he is the <small>FIRST</small>
who has paid his respects to him.</p>

<h2>REMARKS ON A LATE BOOK, &amp;c.</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> Writer of the <i>Inquiry into the Rejection
of the Christian Miracles by the Heathens</i><a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
having, as he is well assured<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, an undoubted
claim to one of the two reasons for making a
work public, <i>that what it contains</i> <small>SHOULD</small> <i>be
new</i>, and not willing that so uncommon a merit
should be thrown away upon his reader, is
careful to advertise us of this point himself,
and accordingly flourishes upon it with much
apparent alacrity and satisfaction through a
great part of his Preface. For, not content
with this bare assertion of his claim, he grows
so elate, as to wonder this important theme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
should be reserved for him<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>, and that no sagacity
of former times had been blessed in the
discovery. Nay, lest his very Patron should
neglect him, or as if he suspected my Lord
might look no farther than the Dedication, he
scruples not to mention even there the excellency
of his work; and is very frank in declaring
his own <i>good opinion</i> of it<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>.</p>

<p>An exordium like this, we know, is generally
inauspicious. However, it may serve to one
end, not the least considerable, it may be, in
an author’s views, to engage the public attention.
For it is indeed but natural to inquire
into the peculiar merit of a work that could
inspire its writer with such boasts, and fill a
place in it, till now sacred to a real or pretended
modesty, with such unusual confidence and
triumph. And this, we are told, consists in
<i>the discovery of a new solution of a difficulty
about miracles<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>, which had long perplexed the
Inquirer more than all the rest put together</i>. For,
taking into his consideration the argument for
the divinity of our holy Religion, as arising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
therefrom, <i>he could not help thinking it extremely
odd, that such numbers of men, for so long a
time, could reject what to Christians in general,
and himself in particular, seemed to be of so
great weight</i><a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. And the embarras he was under
from this difficulty put him <i>upon looking for
some solution of it amongst the variety of authors
on this subject, both ancient and modern</i>; but
to no purpose, it seems, till the felicity of his
own genius had struck out a new route, and
led him to seek it <i>in the low opinion which the
heathens entertained of miracles</i>.</p>

<p>And now the whole discovery is out; and,
to say the truth, is every way so surprizing,
that an author of less modesty than ours had
assumed a still farther merit upon it. For,
wherefore else should he rest in the honour of
a new <i>solution</i>, when the <i>objection</i> itself is <i>his</i>?
And surely at this time of day, when every
species of hostility has been tried, and the
whole armoury of the enemy been exhausted
in the service, it must be deemed a higher
praise of <i>invention</i> to have furnished new arms,
than to counteract the use of them. Nor do I
pay the author too great a compliment in supposing
the objection <i>his</i>, since he fairly owns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
<i>it has always been passed over</i><a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>, which, in an
age like this, when every difficulty relating to
Revealed Religion has been sedulously urged,
and honestly examined, is in effect saying it
was never <i>started</i>. And, indeed, this is so much
the case, that, instead of dreaming of any objection
from this quarter, Christian writers have
universally agreed in representing the quick
and speedy conversion of the heathen world, as
an undeniable evidence of its divinity. And,
for the truth of the fact, they appeal to the
testimony of the heathens themselves complaining
of the enormous growth of the <i>new
sect</i>; which had spread itself over at orders
and degrees of men, insomuch that their altars
were neglected, and the temples of their gods
left in a manner desolate<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>. Nay, the Christian
apologists, we know, braved them to their very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
face with the incredible progress of Christianity<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.
And thus, instead of its being true, as the Inquirer
candidly insinuates, <i>that there was something
so exceedingly perplexed and intricate in
the subject itself, or something so critical and
dangerous in the solution of it, that it was always
thought proper to be kept from view</i><a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>, nothing,
on the contrary, can be more evident than that
there is no difficulty to be accounted for at all;
or, if some more forward projector should affect
to make one of it, the pretence might easily,
and without any danger, admit a <i>solution</i>. So
that, upon the whole (if a dealer in novelties
were not too much disgraced by so <i>stale</i> an
allusion), one should be apt to regard the
learned writer as having been pushed on to this
Inquiry by much the same spirit as, in an evil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
hour, led the valorous Knight of <i>Manca</i> out
upon his rambles. For, struck with the conceit
of his own superior prowess, and considering
withal the loss the world might sustain by his
not appearing in it, he marched forth into the
land of Religious Disputation, in quest of adventures;
where, finding no <i>real</i> objections to
encounter, he was determined however to create
<i>imaginary</i> ones, and so, converting the next
innocent thing he came at into a monster, laid
out his whole strength and force in the combat.
Where too the success of the adventurers is
not unlike. For the difficulty, if it be one, is
much too hard for the abilities of our Inquirer;
as, whatever his antagonist was, the unlucky
Knight had always the worst of it. For, in
examining the other part of the author’s discovery,
his answer to the supposed objection,
we shall find that as he set out with a difficulty
without grounds, so he will salve it by a fact
without proof. And this, it will be owned, consistently
enough: for, where a phantom only is
to be engaged, the hero but exposes himself
that goes against it in <i>real armour</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">——Frustra <i>ferro</i> diverberet <i>umbras</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But let us hear the fact itself. It is maintained
then as the basis of the Inquirer’s whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
work, <i>that the heathens in general had a very
low opinion of miracles; and that this was not
put on by them to serve some particular purposes,
but was really a principle that influenced
their actions on the most interesting and trying
occasions</i><a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. The Inquirer has more than once<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
expressed his apprehensions that the <i>novelty</i> of
his doctrine would, at least with many of his
readers, be a prejudice against its reception;
but not once, that I can find, does he appear to
have entertained any the least distrust or concern
about the truth of it. And yet the public
will be apt to think this the fitter object of his
fears. For, allowing the utmost weight and
force to the several testimonies he has put together,
the whole amount of their evidence is
this:—<i>that a few particular persons, many of
them under inveterate prejudices against Christianity,
expressed but a low opinion of miracles,
which they knew to be</i> <small>FALSE</small>, <i>or of certain</i> <small>REAL</small><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
<i>ones, which they did not believe</i>. And where is
the wonder? Or how has the Inquirer, with
all his sagacity, been able to collect a proof of
the <i>low opinion of miracles amongst the heathen
in general</i> from the unavailing evidence of
such witnesses? For, is it strange that the
Roman præfects<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> were not the immediate converts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
of Jesus and Paul, on account of the
wonders said to have been done by them? If
the Inquirer believes such testimonies to his
purpose, I will engage to furnish a long list of
them, even as many as there were unconverted
heathens, who had the means and opportunity
of informing themselves of the truth of his
history. Is it remarkable that the miracles of
one impostor<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> are not spoken of with <i>much</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
esteem by writers, who were not delivering the
popular opinion concerning them, and who had
plainly too much sense to believe them themselves?
Or is it so much as <i>true</i>, either of
him, or the others he mentions, that they were
then negligently treated by their professed admirers
and encomiasts<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>? Or, were it <i>true</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
could any thing more be collected from it than
that the miracles imputed to them were too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
trifling in themselves, or too weakly supported,
to be believed?</p>

<p>But we have not yet done with the writer’s
negative testimonies. For he thinks <i>that</i> of
<i>Marcellinus</i> should not be passed over; though
the most he can make of it is, that the historian
<i>dissembles</i> a miracle<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> wrought to the utter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
confusion of his Master, and <i>relates an event,
which he was not at liberty to confute</i>.</p>

<p>What comes next is indeed <i>positive</i>, but still
less to the writer’s purpose. We can scarce
think him serious, when he would urge the
testimony of Hierocles, Celsus, and Julian, the
avowed and virulent opposers of Christianity<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>,
as an evidence of a general contempt of miracles
in the heathen world. Nor has he better
luck with his philosophers. For, is the opinion
of a few atheistical speculatists<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>, and perhaps
one or two more of better fame, of the least
weight in deciding this matter; especially when
it is plain, from the very passage referred to<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
that they saw through the imposture of the
heathen miracles; and rejected them <i>merely</i> on
that account? Can his Ægyptian Gymnosophists,
piqued, as they were, at the reputation
of the Indian miracles<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>, and yet, in effect,
confessing their esteem of them by pretending
to work such themselves, can these witnesses
be thought deserving the least credit? Above
all, is the wonder-working <i>Apollonius</i> brought
in to disclaim miracles, and that too in a passage
intended only to express his contempt of some
fooleries in witchcraft<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>? But what the <i>philosophers</i>
could not do for him, the <i>law-givers</i>
he resolves shall, and therefore brings in a long
list of sages<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>, all of them, as he thinks, concurring
to establish this point. But how?
Why, in his <i>negative</i> way of witnessing, <i>in
their making no pretence to miracles</i>—that is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
as every body sees, in their making no pretence
to what they <i>durst not</i> counterfeit, or <i>did not</i>
want; and when it is certain they <i>did pretend</i>
to them in the only safe way of a secret intercourse
and communication<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. But the cause
is growing still more desperate. For, are the
Christian Apologists to be charged with this
<i>evil principle</i><a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>? and that only for maintaining,
in their occasional disputes with the heathens;
what the ablest Divines have ever done, and
still continue to maintain, the insufficiency of
miracles <i>alone</i>, and if taken <i>by themselves</i>, to
establish the divinity of any revelation? an
opinion founded, as it should seem, on the express
testimony of Jesus Christ<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>; or, if <i>false</i>,
which has not been made appear, excusable
enough in their situation, when <i>real</i> miracles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
were owned to be in the power of evil spirits,
or when at least the general prevalency of this
persuasion amongst their heathen adversaries
might render it expedient for the Christian
writers to argue on the concession of it. But,
ill as this treatment is, the venerable Apologists
have no cause of complaint. They share but
the same fate, as <small>ONE</small> much their better. For,
the <i>dignity</i> of the writer’s witnesses, whatever
becomes of their <i>evidence, is still increasing</i><a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>;
and having made free with the <i>Fathers</i> of the
Church (for I say nothing of his <i>Jews</i>, not only
because he confesses them nothing to his purpose<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>,
but because, if their evidence has any
weight at all, it <i>determines</i> the contrary way<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>),
having, as I said, made free with the <i>Fathers</i> of
the Church, he next claims the sanction of an
<i>Apostle</i>. Has then the Inquirer one <i>sure</i> and
<i>certain</i> retreat? And is his novelty at last, all
spent and wearied as it is, to elude our hopes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
by finding refuge in the sacred writings<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>? So
indeed he would persuade himself or his readers.
And this, it must be owned, is <i>no novel practice</i>.
It is ever the last expedient of a sinking cause,
when forsaken of all human help, and fearing
the just vengeance of indignant reason, to strive
to support itself by laying hold on the altar.
But the Scriptures are no <i>sanctuary</i> for falshoods.
We shall therefore esteem it no irreverence
to approach the holy place, and, as we
are instructed in a like case, to take the <i>fugitive</i>
from it. The case appears to have been this:
In the Apostle’s design of breaking an unchristian
faction in the Church of Corinth,
which had arose, it seems, from a vain ostentation
of human science, his business was to
discredit their misapplied learning with the
people, and to check the arrogance of these
<i>perverse disputers</i> themselves. To this end, he
sets himself to shew that it was not on account
of any advantage of skill in human learning or
eloquence that God was pleased to make choice
of the preachers of the Gospel; but that, on
the other hand, he rather chose the <i>foolish</i>, i. e.
the illiterate and uneducated, the better to expose
the weakness of human wisdom, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
display, with greater force, the power and excellency
of the <i>Cross of Christ</i><a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. And this,
he proceeds to observe, is but agreeable to the
general œconomy of God’s providence, which
doth not conform itself to our views of fitness
or expediency; but most commonly by the
choice of such instruments and means as to us
seem <i>unfit</i> or <i>inexpedient</i>, <i>destroys the wisdom
of the wise, and brings to nothing the understanding
of the prudent</i><a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. A remarkable example
of which method of dealing with mankind,
continues the Apostle<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>, we have in the
dispensation of the Gospel, <i>introduced</i> in such
a manner, and <i>established</i> by such means, as
both to <i>Jew</i> and <i>Gentile</i> appear absurd and
unaccountable. <i>For the Jews ask after a sign</i>,
i. e. look for an outward ostentatious display
of worldly power and pre-eminence going along
with, and attending on the Messiah; and,
under the influence of such prepossession,
make that a <i>sign</i> or test of his coming, and
even refuse to acknowledge his Divine mission
without it<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>. Whilst the Greeks, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
seduced by the charms of a studied eloquence,
or inslaved to the tenets of a conceited
philosophy, require the Gospel to be preached
in agreement to their notions and prejudices;
and reject a Redeemer, whose method of salvation
is not conformable to the conclusions of
their schools, and whose doctrine is unadorned
by the graces of their learning. Whereas, in
fact, proceeds the Apostle, our commission is
to publish, in all plainness, a religion to the
world, fundamentally opposite to the prejudices
of both. For its main doctrine, and on which
hangs all the rest, is that of a <i>crucified Saviour</i>;
which therefore, as being offensive to the fond
hopes and expectations of the Jew, and not
suited to his ideas of the <i>Divine power</i> and
greatness, is to him a <i>stumbling-block</i>: And
being a method of salvation neither agreeing
to their conceptions of the Divine <i>wisdom</i>, nor
set off with the colours of heathen wit, is to
the Greeks <i>foolishness</i>. Though yet it is to
both these <i>Jews and Greeks</i>, when rightly instructed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
in the ways of God’s Providence, <i>both
the power of God and the wisdom of God</i><a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
Thus we see, at length, what the writer’s
sacred authority is come to; which, having no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
foundation but in the groundless comment
a mistaken passage is thus easily overturned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
and confuted. For from hence it appears, that
the Apostle, far from attesting his whimsy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
<i>the low opinion of miracles amongst the heathens</i>,
does not so much as of Miracles
at all: or, if he must be made an evidence in
the cause, gives judgment against him; as
plainly enough expressing his opinion, that it
was not a <i>contempt of miracles</i>, but the <i>conceit
of wisdom</i>, which made the great difficulty
to converting the Pagan world.</p>

<p>And now having dispersed his <i>cloud of witnesses</i>
(which, unlike the <i>sacred</i> one it would
seem to resemble, instead of illustrating and
reflecting a fuller light on the <i>fact</i> it surrounds,
serves only to obscure and conceal it)
having shewn, I say, if not the falshood of his
<i>fact</i>, at least the insufficiency of his <i>evidence</i> to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
support it, I might fairly dismiss the remainder
of his book without any confutation; the following
chapters, as he tells us, being intended
to account for this fact, which he presumes to
have fully established. But, as he appears unwilling
to rest the whole of his cause on the
merit of so slight an evidence, and has therefore
engaged for a further confirmation of it in
the following pages<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>, it will be proper to
collect in a few words, what additional evidence
may arise from that quarter: And in
doing this, I shall think it sufficient to examine,
not his premises, but conclusion; and
so, leaving him in full possession of his <i>facts</i>,
to argue with him, in agreement to the design
of these slight sheets, on the weight and force
of his deductions. And here,</p>

<p>1. Allowing him to have proved <i>the vanity
of the heathen pretensions to miracles</i>, c. iv.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
v. vi. in the fullest sense he can wish; and
that no <i>real wonder</i> was ever wrought, or
<i>oracle</i> delivered, by any of the numerous pretenders
to either, what will the author say is
the proper inference from it?—That therefore
the heathens <i>could</i> not but have a low opinion
of miracles? That, indeed, would be to his
purpose; but nothing can be less supported.
For were not such miracles and oracles at
least generally believed? Or, if several impostures
were detected, does the author imagine
that such detection would utterly sink the
credit of all future miracles<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>? A writer, so
skilled in the workings of superstition, and
who appears to have taken much pains to pry
into the dark corners of humanity, ought to
know, that the passion for wonder is a foible
too <i>intimately</i> connected with our nature to be
thus easily driven out from it. And the history
of mankind gives the strongest confirmation
of this, in relating, as it does, notwithstanding
the presumed effect of such discoveries,
the very ready reception, which Miracles
have ever met with. The truth is, the Inquirer
might as well have set himself to prove <i>the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
vanity of the Popish pretension to miracles</i>,
and then have inferred, from the frequent detection
of impostures amongst them, that
therefore the Papists cannot but have <i>a very
low opinion of miracles</i>. This, I say, had
been as logically inferred; and yet, I believe
the first traveller from Rome, or next account
he should look into of Italy, or Spain, would
infallibly spoil the argument, and confute his
conclusion. And, to do the author justice,
he seems not unconscious of this, when, after
all the learned pains he had taken to establish
this point, he allows, <i>that though his argument
had shewn, what little reason the heathens had
to think, that miracles had ever been wrought
amongst them at all, yet it does not of consequence
follow, that they would certainly make
use of the light, that was held out to them</i>; but
observes, <i>that whether they did or not, their
esteem of miracles will be but little increased;
for if ever they were alarmed by an appearance,
which they could not tell how to account for, or
over-borne by the weight of such testimony, as
they could not tell how to invalidate, the principle
of magic was one general recourse</i>.</p>

<p>2. His strong-hold, then, we see, at last, is
Magic. We shall follow him therefore one
step further, and try if we cannot dislodge him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
from it. The fact conceded to him is, <i>that
the persuasion was pretty general in the heathen
world, that by means of magic, that is,
of certain superstitious rites, and sacrifices, and
by certain words and invocations of dæmons,
many things could be done exceeding the power
of man; and that accordingly many seeming
miracles, wrought amongst them, were imputed
to this power of magic</i>. But then to infer
from hence, as the Inquirer would have us,
that therefore the heathens under the persuasion
of these principles, must necessarily
entertain a very low opinion of <i>all</i> miracles,
is sure concluding too fast. For, though I
could admit this to be a tolerable reason for the
rejection of <i>some Pagan</i> miracles, it does not,
we see, at all affect the <i>Christian</i>; which <i>only</i>
are, or ought to be, the concern of his book.
So that the argument, fairly stated, confutes
itself. For it stands thus: The heathens conceived
many miraculous appearances, produced
for some <i>trifling</i> or <i>noxious</i> purpose, to be in
the power of certain persons, acting under the
power of <i>bad dæmons</i><a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>, and by the means of
certain <i>magical, and superstitious rites</i>.—<span class="smcap">Therefore</span>
they of necessity entertained a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
low opinion of <i>all</i> miracles, though wrought by
pawns, claiming their power and pretensions
from <i>God</i> himself, for purposes the most <i>momentous</i>
and <i>benevolent</i>, and without the interposition
of <i>any</i> sacrificial or superstitious rites<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.
But this is not all: We learn from the history
of the propagation of Christianity, that in certain
places (and who can doubt in all where
the pretended powers of magic were opposed
to the genuine workings of the Spirit of God?)
such methods were used by Christ and his
Apostles, as were sufficient to manifest the
difference of their miracles from those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
magicians, and to assert the divinity of their
mission, in the very judgment of the magicians
themselves<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. And this, as it seems,
always with such illustrious evidence, as to
render it inexcusable in those, who had the
opportunity of seeing and examining the difference,
to remain unsatisfied of it. For I
cannot but think it worthy the Inquirer’s regard,
though no <i>novelty</i>, that the Heathen charge of
<i>magic</i>, was but in other words the Jewish
accusation of <i>Beelzebub</i>; either of them the
genuine result of pure unallayed malice, and,
concerning which, our Saviour’s determination
is well known. And therefore when the
learned writer contends, that the Heathens
had a low opinion of miracles in general, on
account of the supposed power and efficacy of
charms, and magical incantations, he might
with equal reason here have taken upon him
to shew, that the Jews also had it low opinion
of miracles in general on account of the supposed
power of their diviners, and sorcerers,
of which we likewise bear much amongst
them, and from their ascribing, as we know
they did, many miraculous effects and operations
to them: an opinion, which, I presume,
the learned writer will not find it to his purpose
to maintain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>3. As to the author’s argument from the
<i>multiplication of the Heathen Gods</i> (which is
the only remaining part of his book I think
myself concerned in<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>) if he means to conclude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
from it, that in consequence of the multitude
of pretended miracles, flowing from such belief,
miracles themselves must of necessity
<i>lose their force, and sink in their esteem</i><a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>, it is
very frivolous, and admits an easy answer.
For, besides its inherent weakness of bad logic,
in concluding from a cause of possible efficiency
to a <i>certain</i> effect, it has the misfortune,
in common with his other reasonings on this
subject, to be confuted by plain matter of fact.
And, for his satisfaction in this point, I refer
him once more to the case of the Romanists;
who, notwithstanding the multiplicity of their
saints, all of them dealers in miracles, and
swarming in such numbers as to equal, if not
exceed, the rabble of Pagan divinities, do not
yet appear to have contracted from thence and
disrelish, or disesteem for miracles. The
truth is, the whole additional evidence arising
from the main of his book in confirmation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
his pretended fact, <i>that the Heathens entertained
a low opinion of miracles</i>, is so very
inconsiderable, that, as we now see, it hardly
amounts to a bare probability. For, after all,
the reader will perhaps incline to think, contrary
to what the learned writer directs him,
that such prevalency of magic, and multiplicity
of gods, is no bad proof of the esteem
and credit, that miracles were in amongst
them. At least, ’tis no unfair presumption,
that a people could not be so averse to miracles,
as the author pretends, nor generally be possessed
by a thorough contempt of them, when,
notwithstanding the frequent detection of <i>false</i>
miracles, and more than one degrading solution
at hand for the <i>true</i>, they should yet be
able to maintain their ground, and take such
footing in the popular belief, as to be continually
affording fresh occasion to imposture,
and fresh encouragement to the dealers in this
traffic to practise on the wonder and credulity
of mankind.</p>

<p>2. And whoever sets out with this surmise,
(which is apparently not ill-founded) will find
it greatly strengthened in observing, that of all
the reproaches cast upon the Heathen world,
and of all the prejudices objected to them by
the first propagators of Christianity, this of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
contempt of miracles was not so much as once
mentioned, there not being the least hint, or
remotest intimation in the sacred writings of
their labouring under any peculiar prepossession
of this kind. A circumstance perfectly
unaccountable, if what the Inquirer contends
for be true, since such prepossession could not
but greatly obstruct the Apostolic labours, and
make it necessary for them to bend their first
care and application that way.</p>

<p>3. And it raises the wonder still higher to
observe, that whilst the Heathens escape uncensured
in this respect, the Jews are severely
rebuked for their incredulity and disregard
miracles<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>; where too, by the very cast and
turn of the reproof, the Heathens are to be
understood as less chargeable on this head, than
the Jews.</p>

<p>4. But, what has still the worst aspect on
the writer’s scheme, is, that whilst the
Apostles are quite silent as to this charge upon
the Gentile, nor appear once to rank it in the
list of such impediments, as retarded the conversion
of the Pagan world, they are at the
same time very express in declaring to us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
what the chief of those <i>impediments</i> were.
They in part have been already suggested<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>,
and were, if St. Paul may be credited, in
reality, these: 1. <i>A conceit of superior wisdom</i>
amongst the men of letters and education<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.
And, 2. <i>The corruptions and gross idolatries</i>
of the people at <i>large</i><a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>.</p>

<p>5. But what! it will after all be asked, Is
there then no truth in what the leaned writer
has advanced concerning the Heathen contempt
of miracles; and in particular, is his
long detail of principles and circumstances,
concurring, as it should seem, to produce
such contempt, utterly without all force or
meaning?</p>

<p>This has no where been said; and the contrary
is what I am now ready to affirm. For,
to do the Inquirer justice, it was upon the
basis of a good, old truth, that this wondrous
novelty was erected. A fine writer<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> will tell
us what it was. “We may observe,” (says
he, in accounting for the silence of Pagan
writers in respect of our Saviour’s history)
“that the ordinary practice of <small>MAGIC</small> in those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
times, with the many pretended <small>PRODIGIES</small>,
<small>DIVINATIONS</small>, <small>APPARITIONS</small>, and <small>LOCAL MIRACLES</small>
amongst the Heathens, made them
less attentive to such news from Judæa, till
they had time to consider the NATURE, the
OCCASION, and the END of our Saviour’s
Miracles, and were awakened by many surprizing
events to allow them any consideration
at all.” We see here the ground-work
of our author’s performance, and have determined
to our hands with great accuracy, how
far his general position is true, and to what
extent the particular circumstances and situation
of the Heathens would in <i>reality</i> affect
their opinion of miracles. Had the learned
writer confined himself within these limits, he
would, I conceive, have had reason and history
on his side, and, whatever alarm he may
be in <i>from the froward and contentious spirit
of party in religion</i>, no <i>enemies</i> to oppose him.
But then this, it must be owned, had been
saying nothing <i>new</i>: The world had lost the
benefit of a discovery, and the author, what
of all things he would most regret, the glory
of INVENTION.</p>

<h3>BY A FELLOW OF A COLLEGE.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span><br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></h3>

<h2>THE OPINION OF AN EMINENT LAWYER<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>, &amp;c.</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> dispute <i>concerning Appeals</i>, which at
present engages the attention of the University
of <i>Cambridge</i>, is apparently of such importance
to the peace and welfare of that great body;
that it could not but be expected from any
one, who proposed to deliver his thoughts
upon it to the world, that he should at least
have taken care to inform himself perfectly of
the merits of the question, before he presumed,
in so public a manner, to concern
himself in it.</p>

<p>It must, therefore, surprize the reader of a
late <i>Inquiry into the Right of Appeal, &amp;c.</i> to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
find, that the writer of it, whoever he be (for
as he chuses to conceal name, I shall not
take the liberty to conjecture of it) should adventure
to treat a matter of this consequence,
without any distinct knowledge of the state of
the case itself, or indeed without appearing to
possess one single qualification, which is required
to do justice to it. For the question,
discussed, is of such a nature, that it cannot
be determined, nor indeed tolerably treated by
any one, who hath not a pretty exact knowledge
of the <i>History</i>, <i>Customs</i>, and <i>Statutes</i>, of the
University; and who is not, besides, at least
competently skilled in the <i>Civil and Ecclesiastical
Laws</i>. And yet this writer, as though
nothing else was required of him, besides a
confident face, and willing mind, boldly undertakes
to decide upon it, under a perfect
incapacity in all these respects. Instead of an
accurate acquaintance with the Practice and
Usages of the University, it appears he had
no further knowledge of them, than what a
few hasty and ill-considered extracts from the
Register had supplied him with. So far is he
from being conversant in the Statutes of the
University, that he blunders in every attempt
to explain the very easiest of them. And, as
to his <i>Law</i>, he has only skimmed the surface
of it for a few frothy terms, without giving the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
least proof of his being possessed, in any degree,
of the sense and substance of it. This utter
inability to discuss a point, he had voluntarily
undertaken, must be thought the more extraordinary
in a person, who, throughout the
whole, assumes an air of authority; and
though he professes modestly in his title page
to <i>enquire</i>, yet, in effect, <i>prescribes and dictates</i>
from one end of his <i>pamphlet</i> to the other.
The tone of this disputer, whatever becomes
of his reasoning, is all along decisive; and he
<i>does and must insist</i>, as if he thought his very
word of force enough to bear down all the
reason and argument, that could be opposed
to him.</p>

<p>Indeed the superior airs he gives himself,
on all occasions, are not without their use.
For persons unacquainted, as the generality of
his readers must needs be, with the question
itself, are readily enough inclined to believe,
that a person so <i>assured</i>, cannot be so entirely
<i>ignorant</i> of the merits of it, as in fact he is.
And they who know better, cannot but apprehend
somewhat from the assumed authority
of a writer, who talks so big; however
his total insufficiency might, in other respects,
provoke their contempt. For my own part,
I could not help considering him as a person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
of eminent dignity in the University; whose
rank in it might give him a right to dictate to
the school-boys of the place; for so he gives
us to understand, he conceives of <i>the Members
of the University Senate</i><a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. In pursuing my
conjectures further about him, I was sometimes
inclined to think, from the very reverend
regard he every where professeth for the Heads
of colleges, that he must, himself, be one of
that illustrious body and was led to excuse
the superiority of his manner from reflecting,
that a habit of governing absolutely in his own
college (for so he thinks Heads of colleges have
a right to govern<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>) had insensibly inspired
that despotic style and language, which were
so disgustful, and had looked so ungracefully,
in any other. But then, again, my profound
respect and esteem of that venerable order, and
my actual knowledge of the great talents, with
which these reverend personages so worthily
preside in their high places, would not suffer
me to imagine, that any of their number could
be <i>so</i> unqualified to treat a matter of a merely
academical nature, as this writer had shewn
himself to be; and especially, as it immediately
concerned their own authority, which
they so assiduously study, and so perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
understand. On the whole, I was forced to
dismiss this conjecture, as having no reasonable
foundation to rest upon, and, in perfect
civility and good manners towards a set of
men, for whom I have so sincere an honour,
could only conclude him, at last, to be some
weak and shallow pedant; unknown and uncountenanced
by <i>them</i>; whose vanity had
done him an ill turn; and thrust him unadvisedly
on a weighty office, which he had no
warrant, as he had no abilities, to discharge.</p>

<p>Under this opinion, both of the writer and
his performance, which, as the reader sees, I
took not up upon slight grounds, it was not
likely I should ever think of giving myself the
least trouble about either; much less that I
should believe it worth the while to undertake
in form, the examination of a foolish pamphlet,
which indeed, I had hardly patience enough
to peruse. The truth is, it had lain for ever
unnoticed by me among the rubbish, which
of late hath so oppressed the publick, on the
subject of our academical disputes; or, at
least, had been left for some future <span class="smcap">Academic</span>
to discourse of, at his leisure; had it not been
for the <i>Opinions</i> of two truly learned and respectable
Lawyers; which the <i>Inquirer</i> had
thought fit to intersperse, as a little needful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
seasoning, in his insipid performance; and
which, indeed, give it all the real weight and
authority, it can possibly carry with it to men
of sense.</p>

<p>The <i>Inquirer</i>, as supposing these gentlemen
to afford some countenance to the good cause,
he is maintaining, thinks fit, on the mention
of their names, to drop his crest a little; and,
in a lower tone of voice than usual, affects to
treat them even with some appearance of respect.
Yet this he does in so aukward a
manner, as shews it was not usual or familiar
to him, to descend to such submissions; for,
as the height of that civility, which he was
willing to express towards them, he chuses
to distinguish them only by the title of the
<i>Gentlemen of the</i> <span class="smcap">Long Robe</span>. What impression
the idea of a sweeping train may possibly
make on the phantasy of this writer, I know
not; but I, who am more concerned about
the <i>heads</i> than the <i>tails</i> of these learned gentlemen,
should have thought it an apter compliment
to have turned our attention the other
way. Unless, perhaps, he was secretly conscious,
that by a little unfair dealing in the
proposal of the <i>Queries</i>, in relation to which
their opinions were asked, their Answers themselves
did no real honour to the more essential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
part of a great lawyer, and so far willing to
pin the credit of them intirely on their <i>gowns</i>.
In plain truth this was the very case, as will
appear from the <i>Queries</i> themselves, and the
<i>Answers</i>; together with a few observations,
which I shall beg leave to subjoin to them.</p>

<p>“After stating the <i>42d</i> and <i>48th</i> of Queen
<i>Elizabeth’s</i> Statues, some circumstances of
Mr. <i>A—’s</i> behaviour, and that an appeal
of the same nature with his was not quite
unprecedented, the two following Queries
were put, [<i>Inq. p. 28.</i>]</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Qu. I. Whether, in this case, the Vice-Chancellor
and his assessors have not
acted solely under the <i>42d</i> Statute; <i>de
Cancellarii Officio</i>; and whether any appeal
can lie against the suspension of <i>A.</i>
by virtue of that Statute? or whether this
case must be deemed one of the <i>causæ
forenses</i>, and of consequence subject to
an appeal by virtue of the <i>48th</i> Statute, <i>de
Causis Forensibus</i>?</p>

<p>“Qu. II. Whether, if in the case above stated,
the said <i>A—</i> hath a right to appeal from
his suspension; the same right of appeal
will not follow to every delinquent scholar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
who shall be punished a trifling mulct or
piece of exercise by the Vice-Chancellor?”</p>

</blockquote>

<p><i>After stating</i>, says he, <i>the 42d</i> and <i>48th
Statutes</i>, &amp;c. Whence it appears, that no
other evidence was laid before the Lawyers,
with regard to the right of appeals, than certain
extracts from Q. <i>Elizabeth’s</i> Statutes:
Which was not the most certain method of
obtaining an accurate decision. For, though
the Queen’s Statutes alone, as we apprehend,
afford <i>sufficient</i> evidence of our right, yet they
are by no means, as will presently be seen,
the <i>whole</i> evidence.</p>

<p>But, waving this consideration, let us come
directly to the <i>Queries</i> themselves. The <i>first</i>
is a master-piece in its kind, and may be of
use to instruct future querists, how to propose
their doubts in the most convenient manner.</p>

<p>For instead of asking the Lawyers, whether
the powers, given in the <i>42d</i> Statute, are subject
to appeal, the question is put to them,
whether in suspending Mr. <i>A—</i> they had
acted under that Statute? Again; instead of
inquiring whether the <i>jurisdiction</i> given in the
<i>two Statutes</i> be the same or different, the
Query is (on supposition of a difference) to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
which class of tryals Mr. <i>A—’s</i> case belonged?
In short, the Lawyers were made to believe,
that this was the main point in dispute, whether
the case before them was of a <i>criminal</i>
or (as the <i>Inquirer</i> expresses it) of a <i>forensic</i>
nature.</p>

<p>It would have been hard indeed if a design
so well laid, and so artfully conducted, had
failed of success. Accordingly, we find both
the Lawyers expressly declaring, that the case in
question belonged to the 42d <i>Statute</i>, and from
thence seeming to infer, that an appeal is not to
be allowed.</p>

<p>Answers to the Queries.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“To Q. I. I am of opinion, the Vice-chancellor’s
authority in the case above stated
is well founded by the 42d Statute, <i>de
Cancellarii Officio</i>, and that the Vice-chancellor
and his assessors acted under
that Statute; and that this case does not
fall under the 48th Statute. And I am of
opinion that an appeal does not lie in the
present case.</p>

<p>“To Q. II. This in effect is answered by
what I have said upon the first Question.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
And if an appeal might be allowed in the
present case, it would be of most fatal
consequence to all discipline in the University;
since it would take away all distinction
between the two Statutes; and
every scholar, who should fall under any
censure or punishment inflicted by the
Vice-chancellor, might have his appeal;
and the 42d Statute would be entirely of
no effect.</p>

<p class="author">“<i>Dec. the 12th, 1750. W. N—.</i>”</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>“To Q. I. Upon consideration of the two
Statutes above recited, it seems to me that
the first was calculated to give a jurisdiction
and power to the Chancellor, or, in
his absence, to the Vice-chancellor, to interpose
in criminal matters, <i>i. e.</i> in matters
relating to discipline: the latter gives a
jurisdiction or cognizance in civil matters,
<i>i. e.</i> matters of controversy concerning civil
rights: and therefore the first gives power,
<i>contumaces, &amp;c. suspensione graduum, carcere,
aut alio leviori supplicio judicio suo
castigare</i>: by the latter, power is given to
determine <i>causas et lites</i>, <i>viz.</i> <i>causas forenses</i>,
for that is the title of the Statute. As
to the first, I think that the jurisdiction is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
final in the first instance: for his power is
<i>judicio suo castigare</i>; and it must necessarily
be so, for immediate imprisonment
seems to be one of the punishments which
he may inflict against which there can be
no appeal, for it may be executed before
there can be any appeal. As to the other,
<i>viz.</i> the civil jurisdiction, there the statute
requires speedy determinations; but gives
an appeal from his sentences in <i>foro</i>, and
prescribes the manner of appealing. Upon
these principles, I think that no appeal can
lie, the suspension of <i>A—</i> being grounded,
I think, on the Statute <i>de Cancellarii Officio</i>;
and that this is not <i>causa forensis</i>
within the latter Statute.</p>

<p>“To Q. II. If all offences against the Statutes
are punishable by this Statute, the
punishments for the <i>minora</i>, as well as
the <i>majora delicta</i>, would be appealable;
which I think would be absurd.</p>

<p class="author"><i>Linc. Inn, Dec. the 13th, 1750. R. W—.</i>”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It is seen that both these opinions rest on
one common foundation, <i>viz.</i> that the 42d <i>Statute</i>
gives authority in none but <i>criminal</i>, the
48th in none but <i>civil</i> causes. Now if this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
support shall appear to be wholly imaginary,
all that is built upon it must fall to the ground.
Let us proceed then to examine the Statutes
themselves; or rather simply to represent what
is contained in them. We shall have no occasion
for nice distinctions, or remote inferences;
the plain literal sense of the passages
to be cited will overthrow at once the principle
we are opposing; will afford such an evidence
as cannot be resisted, until a method of interpreting
shall be found out, wholly independent
on the received rules of Criticism and Grammar.</p>

<p>The 42d Statute is entitled <i>De Cancellarii
Officio</i>, and contains an enumeration of the
various powers conferred on him by the University.
It gives him a right <i>to hear and decide
controversies</i>; <i>to call congregations</i>; <i>to give
and refuse degrees</i>; <i>to punish the transgressors
of the Statutes</i>; <i>to see that the University officers
do their duty</i>; <i>to inflict censures on some
particular sorts of offenders therein named, in
some cases with, in others without, the consent
of the Heads</i>; <i>to give or refuse leave to Members of
the Senate to go out of a Congregation
before it is ended, and to impose a mulct on those
who depart without leave</i>; <i>to require the presence
of regents and non-regents at Congregations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
and</i> Conciones ad clerum, <i>and to punish
the absent</i>; and, lastly, <i>to make new Statutes,
with the consent of the University</i>.</p>

<p>Now I think I may safely refer it to any
reader, whether the single design of this Statute
was to convey authority in <i>criminal causes</i>?
or, whether it be not manifestly an enumeration
of the various branches of the Chancellor’s
power, intended to give, at once, a general view
of the whole?</p>

<p>If any one shall think that the administration
of <i>civil</i> justice is not here included, I must
desire him to read again the very <i>first</i> clause.
<i>Cancellarius potestatem habebit ad</i> <small>OMNES</small>—<i>controversias—tum
audiendas tum dirimendas</i>.
Nothing sure but the most outrageous zeal for
a desperate cause can make any one affirm that
the word <i>controversias</i> is necessarily confined
to the <i>trials of offenders</i>. But, if not, then
the Statute gives jurisdiction of both sorts, in
civil as well as criminal causes.</p>

<p>With as little foundation has it been asserted
that the jurisdiction given in the 48th Statute
relates only to <i>civil causes</i>. The single ground
of this assertion is the title of the Statute, <i>viz.
De Causis Forensibus</i>. It happens that a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
set of men, by endeavouring for a long
time to deceive others, have in the end deceived
themselves. For I would, in charity, suppose
them to be sincere, when they translate <i>causæ
forenses</i>, <i>causes between party and party</i>. It
is true, no such use of the words can be found
in ancient authors, or, in what might have been
more convincing to them, modern Dictionaries.
But what then? Admitting that a school-boy
would have construed these words <i>trials in
court</i>, or <i>public trials</i>, yet this sure cannot be
alledged as a precedent to grave and wise men:
much less can it be expected they should reverence
quotations drawn from heathen writers,
who had no idea at all of the ways of supporting
discipline in an University.</p>

<p>But if the <i>title</i> of the 48th <i>Statute</i> will not
confine the jurisdiction it gives, what shall we
say to the Statute itself? It begins with these
plain words, never afterwards restrained or limited,
<small>OMNES</small> <i>causæ et lites, quæ ad Universitatis
notionem pertinent, tam Procancellarii
quam Commissarii judicio subjiciantur</i>. If this
clause be not general, I should be glad to know
whether a general clause be possible? whether
any words can be invented of sufficient extent
to include trials of every sort? But it is not
indeed to be thought strange that the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
profound critics, who would confine <i>omnes controversiæ</i>
to <i>criminal</i> causes, should confine
<i>omnes causæ et lites</i> to <i>civil</i> causes only.</p>

<p>After all, I have a good mind to give up this
point, for the sake only of trying the experiment,
what advantage can be made of it: Let
it, then, be supposed that the jurisdiction given
in the 48th <i>Statute</i>, and the appeals allowed in
it, belong only to <i>civil</i> causes; and let it be
further supposed that the 42d Statute relates
merely to <i>criminal</i> causes. What will follow?
That the Queen’s <i>Statutes</i> allow no appeals,
for <i>that the omission in this Statute amounts
to a prohibition</i>? Nothing can be wider
from the truth than this conclusion. For, 1st,
the powers given to the Chancellor may not be
exercised in an arbitrary manner, but in strict
conformity to the customs and privileges of the
University: If this restriction were not always
to be understood, the Chancellor might confer
<i>degrees</i> by his <i>sole</i> power; for no mention is
made in the Statute of the consent of the University.
The powers, then, here given to the
Chancellor are to be <i>limited</i> by the known
rights of the <i>Senate</i>; and among these rights
no possible reason can be given why that of
<i>appeals</i> should not be included: a right (as
will presently appear) of very great antiquity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
perhaps not less ancient than the University
itself. 2dly. The very same clause which impowers
the Chancellor to judge <i>omnes controversias
Scholasticorum</i>, that is (as we are now
to render the words) <i>all offences committed by
Scholars</i>, requires him to judge <i>secundum jus
civile et eorum privilegia et consuetudines</i>; and
consequently to judge not finally, but under
an obligation of having his sentence <i>re-examined</i>
on an appeal made to the University.</p>

<p>There is another argument in Mr. <i>W—’s</i>
opinion, which seems indeed at first sight, to
be more specious. He observes that the Chancellor
is to punish <i>contumacy</i> and some other
<i>offences judicio suo</i>, and seems to think these
words might be intended to prevent <i>appeals</i>.
But the learned person must excuse my differing
from him also upon this head. The Queen’s
Statute <i>De Off. Cancell.</i> is copied, with some
alterations, from a Statute upon the same subject
in the <i>first</i> collection, she gave the University;
as that was <i>verbatim</i> from one of King
<i>Edward’s</i>. In this Statute the Chancellor was
empowered to punish <i>judicio suo et assensu
majoris partis præfectorum collegiorum</i>; that
is, he was appointed <i>judge</i>, they <i>assessors</i>. But
the latter Statute of Queen <i>Elizabeth distinguished</i>
these punishments into two sorts, regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
being had to the importance of the punishments
themselves, and to the rank and condition
of the offender. In causes of less moment,
and towards offenders of inferior rank,
the Chancellor was to proceed <i>judicio suo</i>; in
others, <i>non sine consensu præfectorum collegiorum</i>.
These <i>two</i> clauses being so manifestly
<i>opposed</i>, we cannot surely mistake, if we interpret
the former <i>by his sole judgment</i>, or <i>by
his single authority</i>; and suppose that nothing
further was intended than to enable him to
pass sentence, <i>without</i><a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> the concurrence of the
Heads; a circumstance which will never shew
that his decision ought to be <i>final</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

<p>There is one point more in which I cannot
help dissenting from the gentleman last named.
He seems to think there can be no appeal from
a sentence of imprisonment; because such
sentence is to be executed <i>immediately</i>. But
I need not observe to so good a judge, that
an appeal <i>apud acta</i> may suspend this execution;
and he has not favoured us with his
reasons why this manner of appealing may not
be allowed (as it always has been allowed) in
the University.</p>

<p>As to the <i>second Query</i>, it is a doubt altogether
superfluous; and seems to have been
proposed for no other reason than to obtain
opinions concerning the <i>expediency</i> of appeals;
which is not surely a point of <i>law</i>. The learned
gentleman, who has declared his sentiments on
the question, must therefore pardon us if we
do not receive them with the same deference,
as if the subject had fallen within the proper
limits of his profession.</p>

<p>But I think it unnecessary to dwell any
longer on these <i>Queries</i>, or the <i>Answers</i> to
them; since it is clear that the learned persons
were abused by a partial and unfair representation
of the case; of which had they been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
fully informed, as they should have been, by
laying before them a just view of the question
in debate, and by furnishing them with the
proper materials for decide upon it; there is
no reason to doubt that persons, so eminently
qualified to judge of all disputes of this nature,
would have given much more satisfactory opinions
about it, and such as the University
might safely admit, as decisive in the present
case. And I think myself authorized to say
this the more confidently, as it luckily happens
that the <i>proper</i> Queries concerning this very
point were, some years ago, put more honestly
by a very excellent person, at that time Vice-chancellor
of the University; and therefore
answered very <i>differently</i> by the greatest Lawyer<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
of this or any age; from whose decision
though there lies an appeal, yet his sentence
never <i>was</i>, as indeed no good man had ever
cause to wish it <i>should</i> be, reversed.</p>

<p>These Queries, together with the Answer
of this great person to them, I purpose laying
before the Reader, as a full and perfect confutation
of all that has been yet advanced
against the <i>right of appeal to the University</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
and carrying with it more authority than any
thing which the most knowing academical advocate
could possibly say for it. But, that the
reader may come the better prepared to judge
of the merits of his determination, and as some
further support to it, for the satisfaction of such
as are unacquainted with the state of the case
itself, I have judged it not improper, in the first
place, to draw together <i>a brief historical account
of the jurisdiction of the University</i>; collected
from authentic monuments, which are well
known to such as are versed in academical
matters; and which, if there shall be occasion,
will be produced at large in a more proper
place.</p>

<p>The University of <i>Cambridge</i> was possessed
of a jurisdiction over its own members, as
<i>clerici</i>, many years before <i>any</i> was granted to
it by charter from the Crown. This jurisdiction,
being ecclesiastical, seems to have been originally
derived from the Bishop of the diocese.
The causes cognisable by the University were
chiefly causes of correction; the rule of proceeding
in the Court was the ecclesiastical law,
and Statutes of their own making, consonant to
that law. The censures inflicted upon offenders
were either ecclesiastical, <i>viz.</i> <i>excommunication</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
<i>suspension</i>, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> or such as were appointed by
the Statues for particular crimes; and the
names of <i>places</i>, <i>offices</i>, <i>pleaders</i>, the same as
are used in Ecclesiastical Courts to this day.</p>

<p>This jurisdiction was not usually exercised
by the University in its <i>collective</i> capacity. But
a particular officer was empowered to exercise
it, under the name of <i>Chancellor</i>; who as
<i>official</i><a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>, acted by an authority derived to him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
from the University, was accountable to them
for the use of it, and liable to have his acts
annulled at their discretion; every person who
thought himself aggrieved by the Chancellor
being at liberty to apply to the Body for redress.</p>

<p>When an <i>Appeal</i> was brought before the
University, they usually authorized Delegates
to hear and judge it, as was agreeable to the
practice in other Ecclesiastical Courts.</p>

<p>The jurisdiction here described was not originally
independent; for no academical decision
appears to have been <i>final</i>. An Appeal
always lay from the judgement of the University
by their Delegates to the Bishop of the diocese,
till the University was exempted from his authority,
and their jurisdiction made <i>final</i> by
Royal Charters, confirmed by Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>In the reign of <i>Henry</i> III. attempts were
made to carry Appeals <i>directly</i> from the Chancellor
to the Bishop, and so to pass over
the Appeal to the University, which ought to
have been an intermediate step. But <i>Hugh de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
Balsam</i>, Bishop of <i>Ely</i> (the founder of <i>Peter-House</i>),
by a rescript, dated Dec. 1264, entirely
frustrated all such attempts.</p>

<p>Hitherto, the Appeals to the University had
been from <i>causes of correction and censure</i>.
The University was not as yet possessed of
jurisdiction in civil causes. Scholars were first
allowed to implead the burgesses and other
laics of the town of <i>Cambridge</i>, in all kinds of
personal actions, before the Chancellor of the
University, <i>anno</i> 33 <i>Ed.</i> I. From that time,
the University began to acquire a civil jurisdiction,
which, by degrees, was inlarged and
established by grants from the Crown in succeeding
reigns. And now, in consequence of
this jurisdictions, Appeals were extended from
criminal to civil causes. Accordingly, in a
rescript of <i>Simon de Montacute</i>, Bishop of <i>Ely</i>,
which bears date <i>16 cal. April, anno 1341</i>,
there is express mention of Appeals to the
University in causes of <i>both</i> kinds. For the
design of this <i>rescript</i> is to commission the
University to determine <i>finally</i> in all <i>civil</i> causes,
without a further Appeal to his Court; and to
prevent frivolous and vexatious Appeals from
the University to him in <i>criminal</i> causes, by
laying the Appellant under the obligation of an
oath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>

<p>This addition of <i>civil</i> power did by no means
abrogate or lessen the <i>spiritual</i>. We find, in
the reign of <i>Hen.</i> VI. that all sorts of ecclesiastical
authority were adjudged to belong to the
University, by the Prior of <i>Barnwell</i>, the Pope’s
delegate; and it was then made appear, that
all these branches of power had both been
claimed and exercised time out of mind. It is
certain, the <i>probate of wills</i> hath at all times
belonged, and still belongs, to the University.
The power of <i>excommunication</i> was exercised
as late as the reign of <i>Hen.</i> VIII. and the power
of <i>absolution</i> is exercised at this day. This
ceremony is constantly performed on the concluding
day of each term. And here, to observe
it by the way, gentle Reader, a goodly
and reverend spectacle it is, to behold the spiritual
Head of our University spreading his paternal
hands, like another Pope, over his erring
and misguided flock, who, in all humility, receive
his ghostly absolution on their knees.</p>

<p>It is true, the new objects of litigation, introduced
by the royal charters, occasioned an
alteration in the <i>Law</i> of the University. For
the ecclesiastical laws did not suffice for the
decision of controversies about civil rights, particularly
contracts between scholars and townsmen,
and breaches of the peace. From the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
time, therefore, that these new causes came
before the Chancellor, to the reign of <i>Edward</i>
VI. his Court was directed, as our Spiritual
Courts are now, by a mixed kind of law,
made up of canon and civil law<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>. Yet this
must not be understood without restriction.
For the University, like other corporations, had
all along a power of making <i>local Statutes</i>;
and not unfrequently particular <i>usages</i> acquired
the force of Statutes, from long continuance.</p>

<p>But whatever changes were made, either by
express Statute, or in consequence of a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
extended jurisdiction, the practice of appealing
from the Chancellor to the University still continued;
only, as was observed, with this difference,
that it now was allowed in civil, as before
it had been in criminal causes.</p>

<p>The right of appeal which then subsisted
received a fresh confirmation from the Statutes
made by the University itself. In these Statutes
the right is not only referred to and presupposed,
but directions are given in regard to the manner
of exercising it<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>; which directions, till cancelled
by succeeding Statutes, established the
right as effectually as if it had been originally
introduced by Statute. The times when many
of these Statutes were made cannot be fixed;
but it is certain they were collected and transcribed
into the Proctors’ books between the
year 1490 and 1500.</p>

<p>In the reign of <i>Edward</i> VI. a body of new
Statutes was given in a Visitation under an ecclesiastical
commission; which enjoined, among
other things, that the jurisdiction of the
University should be directed by the <i>Civil Law</i>;
that is, as every one understands, a mixture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
the Civil and Canon Law; or what <i>Oughten</i> calls
<i>Jus Ecclesiastico-Civile</i>; the same which prevails
in all Ecclesiastical Courts to this day.
And, in the first year of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>,
Statutes were again given to the University in
a Visitation under a like commission; which
were almost an exact transcript of those before
given in the reign of <i>Edward</i> VI. The right
of appealing from the Chancellor to the University
received no alteration from these Statutes.
For there is no change in either of them
by which such Appeals are forbidden or even
restrained. Accordingly, the practice appears
to have continued to the time when Queen
<i>Elizabeth</i> gave her <i>second</i> body of Statutes
(under the broad seal indeed, but not by Visitors
under ecclesiastical commission), which
was in the year 1570. What alterations have
been made by these, or by the practice of later
times, remains to be considered.</p>

<p>It is plain from several passages in Queen
<i>Elizabeth’s</i> new Statutes, that many of the
ancient Statutes and customs of the University
were designed to be continued; and in Stat.
50 we have a direction given, by which we
may understand what Statutes and customs
were to be preserved, and what not. Those
only she declares to be taken away, <i>quæ Scripturis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
Sacris, institutis nostris, istis Statutis adversari
videbuntur</i>; of which number the practice
of appealing from the Chancellor to the
University was not one.</p>

<p>There is, besides, the less reason to imagine
this practice was abolished, because, in Stat. 42,
the Queen requires all causes to be heared and
determined <i>secundum jus civile</i>; and in her
Charter to the University, confirmed by act of
Parliament, <i>secundum leges et consuetudines
suas, ante tunc usitatas</i>, which, as appears,
were agreeable to the <i>Civil Law</i>. This <i>law</i>
allows Appeals in cases of correction and censure;
and therefore it is <i>certain</i> that Appeals
were allowed by Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>.</p>

<p>Indeed, nothing but a clear and express prohibition
could make us imagine, that the right
of appealing, a right of particular importance,
was designed to be either wholly abolished, or
restrained only to civil causes. And such prohibition,
had it been the Queen’s intention to
forbid Appeals in any case, might the rather
have been expected, as, in the 48th Stat.
where several directions are given concerning
Appeals, <i>one</i> ancient usage of the University<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
in relation to them is expressly forbidden: <i>nec
secunda provocatio omnino admittatur</i>. Yet she
gives not the least hint of restraining Appeals
to any particular sorts of causes; which surely
were an unaccountable omission in this place,
had she actually intended to lay them under
any such restriction. And, indeed, it is evident
from a <i>MS.</i> of unquestioned authority,
that neither the Body of the University, nor
the Heads themselves (some of them supposed
to have been concerned in compiling the Statutes),
had the least imagination of such restraint.
What I mean is, a <i>MS.</i> in <i>C. C. C.
Library</i>, containing <i>some Complaints of several
of the Body of the University, in the year 1572,
against Queen</i> Elizabeth’s <i>second edition of Statutes,
and the Answers of the Heads, &amp;c.</i> One
of their complaints is <i>the frustrating</i> Appellations,
by transferring the power of nominating
Delegates from the <i>Proctors</i>, in whose hands
it was before lodged, to the <i>Caput</i>; and by
encreasing <i>the forfeit of Appeals</i>, from a very
inconsiderable sum to 20<i>s.</i> with an addition of
2<i>s.</i> to be paid to the Proctor; an expence
which, as was then urged by the Body, would
prevent <i>poor scholars injured from the benefit
of appealing, having not so much money</i>. What,
now, is the answer of the Heads to this complaint?
Why, that, <i>for the stay of the quietness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
of the University</i>, it was necessary to lay
Appeals under these restrictions. Not a syllable
is said against the right of appeal itself in any
case; though the complainants had expressly
set forth the importance of having Appeals unincumbered
by these limitations, for the <i>redress
of wrongs</i> in <i>general</i>. Nay, the wrongs they
apprehended are even specified; such as punishments
<i>of a regent in the regent-house, for
modestly asking a question; or of a disputer,
for modestly disputing</i>; which, if we are to call
them <i>causes</i> at all, are surely <i>causes of correction</i>.</p>

<p>Nay, so far are these Statutes from <i>prohibiting</i>
Appeals, that they have actually given
the strongest sanction to this practice, by admitting
the right in very general terms, and
prescribing rules for the exercise of it. <i>Stat.</i> 48.</p>

<p>The subsequent practice till of late years
cannot now be known, either from the neglect
or corruption of the University <i>Registers</i>, who
have not taken care to record the proceedings
before Courts of Delegates. Only a few loose
papers have been accidentally preserved, from
which it appears that Appeals were allowed in
<i>civil</i> causes, and there is no reason to imagine
they were discontinued in causes of <i>correction</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
as no distinction was made by the Statutes on
trials between civil and criminal causes.</p>

<p>But if it were true in fact, that no Appeals
had been heared between 1570 and 1725, in
causes of correction and censure, yet this would
not affect the right, any more than the want of
Appeals from a censure of a <i>peculiar</i> sort would
render that single kind of censure unappealable.
For, a right extending to various particulars
will not surely be lessened from want of opportunity
or inclination to exercise it in <i>every one</i>
of them. And such disuse would be the less
strange in the instance before us, because the
discipline of the University hath been chiefly
supported by censures inflicted in particular
Colleges. Little of this business is left to the
Vice-chancellor; and they who know the
University, and wish well to it, will not, perhaps,
desire to see more of it in his hands.</p>

<p>If the supposed disuse of Appeals in criminal
causes shall yet be thought to have abolished
the <i>right</i>, the opinion now to be produced will
at once remove such suspicion; even though
it should not be insisted, as it may, that this
pretended prescription itself is already destroyed,
by <i>three</i> instances of Appeals in <i>causes
of correction</i>, the first of them in the year 1725.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span></p>

<p>But, before I proceed any further, I would
beg leave to make one <i>general</i> observation on
what hath been now advanced. It is this:
A great Civilian had expressly affirmed, “<i>that
Appeals are always admitted in those Courts
where the civil and ecclesiastical Laws are in
force, where penance, suspension, deprivation,
or any censure is inflicted as the punishment
of a fault</i><a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>.”</p>

<p>To all which the writer of <i>the Inquiry</i> gives
his entire assent: <i>The observation</i>, says he, <i>is
undoubtedly just</i>. Now the capable and impartial
reader is left to judge, whether it be not
most evident, from the <i>facts</i> here offered to
his consideration, that the jurisdiction of the
University is, in the properest sense of the
word, <i>Ecclesiastical</i>; and further, whether the
<i>Civil</i> and <i>Ecclesiastical Laws</i> be not <i>of force</i>
in the University Court. The dispute then is
brought to a short issue. <i>Appeals are</i>, by the
full consent Of the Inquirer himself, <i>to be
admitted</i>.</p>

<p>I come now to the <small>OPINION</small> itself; of which
I will only say, further, that it was not given
by the great person hastily or negligently, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
with all the care and deliberation which so important
a matter deserved: as is clear, not only
from his diligence in calling for and inspecting
the <i>Commissary’s Patent</i>, which, he clearly
saw, was of moment to the determination, but
from the time he took to consider it. For the
<i>Queries</i> appear to have been put some time
before <i>Christmas</i>; and this Opinion bears date
the 18th of <i>March</i> following.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Qu.</i> I. “Whether Appeals to Delegates by the
Statute <i>de causis forensibus</i> are restrained
to <i>civil causes</i>, in which two parties are
litigant?”</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> The Statute <i>de causis forensibus</i> is penned
in such general terms, that I think the Appeal
to Delegates thereby allowed cannot be
restrained to civil causes only, wherein two
parties are litigant, but doth extend to causes
of correction and censure; the rather because
the Appeal from the Commissary to
the Vice-chancellor is given in the same
clause, and in the same manner, with the
Appeal from the Vice-chancellor to Delegates;
and the words of the Commissary’s
Patent extend as well to causes of correction
and censure as to civil causes. Now there
can be no doubt but that an Appeal lies from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
the Commissary to the Vice-chancellor in
all cases. The entry in Mr. <i>Tabor’s</i> Register
imports that, even in causes of correction,
an Appeal lies from the sentence of the Vice-chancellor,
when he doth not act jointly
with the major part of the Heads of houses.</p>

<p><i>Qu.</i> II. “Whether by the Statute <i>de Cancellarii
officio</i>, which binds the Vice-chancellor
to proceed <i>secundum jus civile</i>, an
Appeal to Delegates can now lie in a criminal
cause against a prescription of 200
years to the contrary, excepting only the
case of <i>Campbell</i>, <i>anno</i> 1725?”</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> There can be no prescription in this
case, because the question depends on Statutes,
given within such a space of time, as
the Law calls, <i>time of memory</i>.</p>

<p><i>Qu.</i> III. “In case the Delegates should receive
an Appeal, from the Vice-chancellor’s
court in a cause of this kind, and
cite the Vice-chancellor to appear before
them, what the Vice-chancellor should
do? Whether appear before them, and
appeal from the sentence of the Delegates
to his Majesty in council; or not appear,
but apply immediately to his Majesty by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
petition; praying a prohibition, to stop
the proceedings of the Delegates?”</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Supposing that there is a right of
appealing to Delegates, from the sentence
of the Vice-chancellor, in a cause of correction
or censure, no authority can be interposed
to stay the Delegates from proceeding.
But if the Delegates should not
have a jurisdiction, his Majesty in council
cannot grant a prohibition to them: and if
upon an incident of this kind, the Vice-chancellor
should think fit to bring the point
to a judicial determination; the only proper
method, is by applying to some of the courts
at <i>Westminster</i>, for a prohibition to the
Delegates proceeding.</p>

<p class="author"><i>18 March 1730.</i></p>

</blockquote>

<p>The reader sees, by this determination, that
the question turns entirely upon this point;
whether, supposing there had been no Appeals
in cases of discipline from the year 1570 to
1725, as is asserted, but without proof, the
intermission of the exercise of this right for so
long a space, could amount to a legal abolition
of it. To which the great Lawyer, whose
Opinion has been recited, replies expressly, NO.
If any should then ask, what evidence there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
of such a <i>right</i> subsisting at that time? Besides
the Statutes themselves, insisted on in the
Opinion, I can now refer him to the brief hints
which compose the preceding account of the
jurisdiction of the University; and which the
reader may be assured, are advanced on the
best grounds. Much more might, indeed,
have been said; for what I have thought fit to
deliver at present on the subject, is but a small
part of that evidence, which can and will be
produced, if it be found expedient to do it.
In the mean while, I may well excuse myself
from this trouble. For to talk further on
these matters to a person, who appears so
wholly ignorant of the History of the University,
as the <i>Inquirer</i>, were a vain waste of
time; and to take the pains of confuting particular
objections, founded on that ignorance,
a still vainer. Only I will condescend to put
him in mind of one essential defect in his argument
which runs through his whole pamphlet.
It is, that he all along goes on the
supposition, that the <i>express</i> authority of Statute,
is required to make good the claim to
Appeals. And he therefore very idly lays out
his whole strength, in attempting to prove,
that no such express authority is to be found,
either in the <i>old</i> or <i>new</i> Statutes. I own, I
could not but smile, at first, to observe the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
Inquirer addressing himself, with so much importance,
to this task. But, when afterwards
I came to consider, the labour and difficulty,
with which he was forced to make his way,
for this wise purpose, through the <i>discouraging</i>
δυσνόητα (for so I presently saw, he found
them to be) of the <i>old Statutes</i>, I could not,
upon second thoughts, but pity his unnecessary
sufferings about them; and was even
tempted in my own mind, to blame the waggery
of <i>the Fellow of a College</i>, whose request
had drawn him into all this trouble, and who,
to divert himself with him, had plainly put him
on so wrong a scent. The truth is, I could
not think this usage fair in his <i>good friend, to
request him to draw out his sentiments, on such
a point</i>; especially, as he tells us, his time
was <i>so precious</i>, and that he had so little of it
to spare, amidst <i>the variety of his necessary
avocations</i><a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. It had, surely, been more kind
to inform him at once, as I shall have the
goodness to do, that no body, who understood
the matter in debate, ever pretended to found
the right of Appeal on <i>express</i> Statute; it
being well known, that the <i>right</i> stands entirely
on the nature of our <i>jurisdiction</i>; in consequence
of which, there has been a continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
immemorial practice of appealing in the University;
supposed indeed, and admitted in
both the <i>old</i> and <i>new</i> Statutes, and authorized
by the prescription of various rules, for the
exercise of it; but neither expressly commanded,
nor prohibited in either.</p>

<p>And now, having done this act of charity
towards the <i>Inquirer</i>, which may prevent his
future pains, in puzzling and perplexing himself
with the study of the old Statutes; I shall
have reason to expect, in return, his good
leave to expostulate with him pretty freely on
the use, he proceeds to make of this unhappy
blunder. For, plumed with the vain conceit
of the University’s resting their claim on the
sole express authority of Statute, he goes on,
to insult so considerable a body of men, in the
most opprobrious manner; as guilty of the
most absurd and irreverent behaviour, as well
towards our illustrious Chancellor himself, as
the Vice-Chancellor, and his brethren, the
Heads of Colleges. What I mean, is in relation
to the <i>Grace</i>, which the assertors of the
right of appeal thought fit to propose, in order
to refer the decision of this point to the arbitration
of the Senate. He harangues, for several
pages, on what he calls, the irregularity
and indecency of this proceeding; and affects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
besides, to cavil at the substance of what was
proposed in it. But, good Sir, where was the
<i>irregularity</i> of the Senate’s presuming to confirm,
by their own authority, a <i>right</i>, essential
to their constitution, authorized by immemorial
prescription; and which no single
Statute, they act under, in any degree contradicts?
Or, where was the <i>indecency</i> of opposing
the exercise of that power in the Vice-Chancellor,
which is inconsistent with the
very nature of our jurisdiction; for which, he
can plead the sanction of <i>no</i> Statute; and of
which he was never rightfully possessed?</p>

<p>As to the <i>Grace</i> itself, the substance of what
it proposed, was to this effect: “That the
right of appeal, from the sentence of the
Vice-Chancellor to the University in all
cases, should be confirmed to every member
of the <i>University</i>; but that this <i>right</i>, with
regard to persons in <i>statu pupillari</i>, should
be exercised only by the tutor of each person,
interposing in his name.” This, it
seems, gives great offence to the <i>Inquirer</i>;
who, in his tender concern for the authority
of the supreme magistrate, is perfectly shocked,
to think of the consequences of such a right
being acknowledged; and is prophet enough
to foresee, that it would bring the lowest disgrace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
upon his office, by <i>warranting the arraignment
of him</i>, as he puts it, <i>before Delegates,
upon no very important occasions</i><a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>. But his
fears are as groundless, as the insinuation,
which he labours to convey under them, is
impudent and unjust. For, though an appeal
be claimed <i>ab omni gravamine utcunque illato</i>
(which sure is nothing but reasonable, as the
Statutes make no distinction, and the practice,
as well as <i>Law</i> of the University, equally
authorizes Appeals in every case) yet, why
should he throw himself into this unseasonable
panic, when all <i>frivolous and vexatious Appeals</i>
are expressly provided against, by a considerable
pecuniary caution, and when the Delegates
themselves are, in effect, of the supreme magistrate’s
own appointment<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>? Would the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
members of the Senate, does he think, appeal
from any judicial sentence, though ever so
just and statutable, <i>on no very important occasion</i>,
when a certain expence is necessarily
incurred, and when there could not be the
least hopes of redress? Or, would any tutor
can he imagine, who has a character to maintain,
and who is not less concerned to support
good order and discipline, than the supreme
magistrate himself, interpose his claim of Appeal
for his pupil, without, at least, some fair
and reasonable grounds?</p>

<p>But the insinuation, as I observed, is still
more impudent, than his apprehensions are
groundless. For what he would covertly signify
under this impertinent sollicitude for the
honour of the supreme magistrate, is, that the
Delegates, who are the representatives of the
collective body of the University, are unworthy
to take cognizance in any case of the acts of
their <i>officer</i><a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>: Nay, that the members of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
Senate itself are a company of factious, disorderly,
licentious boys; who are impatient of
any authority themselves, and would be sure
to concur in all cases to countenance the irregularities
of one another, or of the youth of
the place; by setting them loose from all restraint,
which the Statutes and discipline of
the University have provided against them.
There is something so outrageously insolent in
this abuse of the body of the University; a
body consisting of <i>three or four hundred persons</i>;
the youngest of which is of the degree
of <i>Master of Arts</i>; almost all of them <i>clergymen</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
and the greater part of <i>equal age</i>, and it
may therefore be presumed of <i>equal prudence</i>,
as many of the Heads themselves; that I should
be cautious of charging it upon him, if he had
not expressed himself in terms too clear to be
mistaken. For he has the assurance to advance
in so many words, that “<i>if the person
who apprehends himself to be aggrieved</i>, may
happen to be a member of the Senate, and,
<i>as such</i>, may possibly <i>bear with indignation
the thought of having any part of his conduct
judicially animadverted upon</i>; if it be further
considered, that his <i>particular friends and
acquaintance</i> may possibly think the same in
his case, and that <i>all the advocates for,
and the warm assertors of independency</i> will
be sure to think so in every case, I do and
must say, <i>&amp;c.</i>” And, again, in the words
of the very provident Mr. <i>Tabor</i>, a little doting
registrary of the University, a century or two
ago; whose mumpings this writer has the confidence
to oppose, to the united sense of the
University, at this day: “What dangerous
cure does that state hazard, when for the
sullen distemperature of one active member,
the ruling head must bleed, that suffereth
enough otherwise; and all the discontented
parts of the body must sit in judgment on it;
nay when <i>Sense</i> must disapprove or disallow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
the <i>acts of Reason</i>? If this Appeal be suffered
and countenanced to pass current, farewell
the power of Chancellor and Vice-chancellor;
<i>my young masters of the regent house</i>
will and must judge, examine, and rule all;
yea, <i>their</i> censures or judgments must stand
or be disallowed at their will and pleasure.
Good Sir! by all means labour to smother
this <i>Hydra</i>; it will have more heads than
we shall overcome, and breed a greater mischief
than we are aware, in these times of
liberty and discontent<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.”</p>

<p>Such are the sentiments of this forward Inquirer
of the Senate of the University of <i>Cambridge</i>:
sentiments, which must needs create
in the breast of any man of sense, who is a
mere stranger to us, the strongest resentment;
and for his public declaration of which, were
the author known and considerable enough,
he would judge him to deserve the severest
censure, the University has it in its power to
inflict. But what must those think, who have
an opportunity of knowing the <i>characters</i> of the
men, whom he thus vilely traduces? Almost
all of them fellows of colleges, many of them
tutors, whose sobriety and good behaviour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
have recommended them to places of trust and
profit in their respective colleges: Men, who
are under the obligation of oaths, to maintain
and promote statutable discipline, and regularity;
who are trained in the habit of restraining
and correcting academical disorders
of all kinds; and whose situations and interests
require them to be as watchful to support just
authority and good order, at least, as the
Heads of Colleges, or the officers of the University
themselves. And the censure is the
more grievous at this time of day, when, by
the confession of the partizans of the Heads
themselves<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>, extorted by the very evidence of
fact and truth, there never was a time in which
the elder part of the University were more
sober, temperate, and regular; when fewer
excesses of any kind were chargeable on the
fellows of colleges; or, indeed, when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
were more prudent and exemplary, in their
behaviour, in all respects. But the charge is
not only unjust, but has a direct tendency to
discredit and destroy that reasonable authority
in the University, which this prater, if he
means any thing by his talk, would seem ambitious
to support. For how is the great affair
of education and good government in this place
to be carried on, but by means of those very
persons, whom he would represent in so ignominious
a light? For, certainly, how much
soever the University may owe to the Heads
of Colleges, in their capacity of <i>legislators</i>,
yet, for the <i>execution</i> of those laws which it
seemeth good to their wisdoms to enact, they
must still depend on the concurrence, I had
almost said, on the sole authority of their <i>inferiors</i>.
And how shall such authority be kept
up, when they are thus upbraided, as abettors
of every act of licence; and represented to the
younger part of the University, as patronizers
of that ungoverned independent spirit, which
it is their office to restrain? Nor can I think
so ill of the policy of these great lawgivers, as
to believe that they will chuse to concur with
this officious <i>Inquirer</i>, in representing them
in such a light. For what will become of that
balmy ease and quiet, in which these sovereign
guides of youth so delight to wrap themselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
if the care of government must, after all, devolve
on their shoulders; when a course of injurious
calumnies shall have disabled their
subordinate ministers from taking their place,
and bearing, as at present they most commonly
do, the full weight of it?</p>

<p>But to return to the <i>Grace</i> itself, from which
this reviler’s treatment of the whole body of
the University has a little diverted me. He
labours much, as I observed, to impress on the
reader’s mind the opinion of the frightful consequences
with which a right of Appeal in all
cases would be attended; and to give a sanction
to these fears, he alledges the authority of
<i>the learned gentlemen of the long robe</i>, who, it
seems, have pointed out the absurdity of such
a practice, and the pernicious effects of it<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.
But what is all this tragical declamation to the
purpose? Where is the sense, as I before
asked, in supposing the University Senate would
concur in every attempt of its idle and disorderly
members to get themselves relieved from
a deserved and statutable censure? Or, how
should those <i>learned gentlemen</i>, whose robe he
still hangs upon, be better able to judge of the
expediency of this practice than the Senate of
the University itself? Indeed he thinks the
absurdity of this right of calling the supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
officer of the University to account for his judicial
determinations the more glaring, in as
much as, even in private colleges, <i>no act of
discipline of the Head</i>, he fancies, <i>was ever
liable to be reversed by any of the subordinate
members</i>: nay, he is persuaded that his good
friend, the Fellow of a College, for whose instruction
all this is designed, <i>were he even authorized
to new model the Statutes of his own
College, would not chuse to vest in his brethren
the Fellows such a power of controuling the acts
of the Master</i><a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>. What the Colleges are which
are here glanced at, and which leave the Master
full power to exercise every act of discipline
without controul, the <i>Inquirer</i> himself best
knows. For my part, I have always understood
that <i>acts of censure</i> in all private societies,
such acts I mean as are of consequence to
the reputation and interests of their members,
are not left to the caprice of the Master, but
are passed by the joint authority and concurrence
of the Society itself; unless, perhaps, I
am to except one <i>little</i> College, in which, it is
said, the Master claims to himself this sovereign
and uncontroulable authority. But, then, this
is no fair precedent. For the members of the
College have nothing to apprehend from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
licentious and wanton abuse of <i>such power</i>; as
well on account of the known candour, equity,
and moderation of the worthy president of that
society, as for that a few exertions of it would
leave him no subjects to preside over.</p>

<p>But, whatever may be the case of this <i>one</i>
foundation, the despotic form is not, I believe,
statutable in any other. Nay, the authority of
the fellows to controul the acts of their Head
in some Colleges, I have been told, goes so
far, that they are even impowered, in case of
an <i>utter inability</i> (such as may arise from extreme
folly, dotage, or the like) <i>to govern prudently</i>,
to remove him forthwith from his place.
And surely this must be deemed a wise and
sober institution; at least, were I <i>authorized to
new model the Statutes of any College which
wanted it, it is such an one as I should certainly
chuse to vest in it</i>.</p>

<p>But there is one circumstance in the <i>Grace</i>
which, it seems, provokes his more <i>especial
dislike</i>. And, unluckily, it is one which any
other, who considered the tenor of it, would be
likely enough more especially to approve; as
shewing the singular moderation and good
temper of the persons who proposed the <i>Grace</i>,
and as studiously contrived to prevent all imaginable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
abuses of it. It is, that <i>the right of
undergraduates to appeal should be exercised
no otherwise than by the interposition of their
tutors</i><a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. A provision of great prudence; and
which the proposers of the <i>Grace</i>, in their concern
to support authority and just government,
purposely made to obviate the only abuses that
could be possibly apprehended from it. For,
if the wanton exercise of the <i>right to appeal</i>
were to be feared from any quarter, it certainly
must be from the inferior members; whose
youth and inexperience might make them forward
to appeal from any censure, however reasonable,
and of which, therefore, the <i>tutor</i> of
the person censured, who is under all the ties
of interest and duty to act discreetly and warily,
is left to judge. Yet this provision, wise and moderate
as it is, <i>appears to the Inquirer extremely
strange; because, by means of such a limitation,
a tutor might prevent his pupil from appealing in
any case, though the supreme Magistrate of the
University would be empowered to prevent it in
none</i>. As if the judge who passed the sentence,
and was therefore concerned to support it, were
as fit to determine, whether the party aggrieved
should have the liberty to appeal from it, as an
indifferent person who had no concern at all in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
it. Nay, the tutor, as was observed, would be
obliged, by a regard to his own authority and
character, and (I would add, but that the <i>Inquirer</i>
is pleased to make no account of that
<i>obligation</i><a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>) by the <i>religion of an oath</i>, to proceed
with all imaginable caution in advising
him to such a step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<p>In every view, then, this objection to the
<i>Grace</i> must appear very unaccountable. And
the rather, when the reader understands that
this clause was, with the greater readiness and
pleasure, inserted into it, as this Vice-chancellor
himself, whose goodness and candour require
no encomiums of mine, had intimated, and
even declared, that a provision of this kind was
all the restriction upon <i>the liberty of appealing</i>
which he wished to see made to it. For this
excellent person was so much convinced of the
propriety and expediency of this claim in general,
that he very frankly professed his approbation
of it, and only wanted to secure his authority,
where indeed the only danger lay, from
a <i>torrent of Appeals, which, as he apprehended,
might pour in upon him from the younger sort</i>.
So that, I think, we shall hear no more of this
objection; and I am even not without the fond
hopes, that, after this information, the <i>Inquirer</i>
himself, whatever <i>displeasure</i> he might conceive
at this part of the <i>Grace</i> before, will now grow
into good humour with it.</p>

<p>After all, one cannot but suspect, that the
<i>Inquirer</i> must have some better reason for his
strong antipathy to this <i>Grace</i> than any that has
yet appeared. The violent heat it puts him
into, whenever he touches upon it, demonstrates,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
there must still be something at the bottom of
this matter, which is the object of just offence.
In looking narrowly for it, I found it at last,
half smothered under a very shrewd and indirect
insinuation, which I shall bring to light,
after having presented the reader with his own
words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I see not how a Grace of this kind could
be offered, consistently with the Resolution
said to have been taken at one of your first
meetings, to assert the right of Appeal in
such a manner as was warranted by the Statutes
of the University: Nor am I less able
to reconcile it with those professions of
deference and respect, which at the same time
were thought proper to be made for our great
and illustrious Chancellor. No person would
receive a greater pleasure than myself from
seeing all the members of the University,
however divided in other points, agreed in
entertaining the highest sentiments of regard
and veneration for him; but I confess, that
this is a pleasure I am not very likely to have;
till one set of men shall be pleased to give
clearer and less questionable testimonies of
this, than by opposing every useful regulation
he recommended, and endeavouring to lessen
and curtail an authority, which is only vested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
in the Vice-chancellor as his representative
and locum-tenens<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here, then, we have all the venom of his
heart injected into one malignant paragraph;
which, under the gilding of a compliment, is
to do its office without offence. And yet, it is
plain enough what he would insinuate. It is
neither more nor less than that the advocates
for this right of Appeal are an unquiet, factious
set of persons, bent on opposing all measures
that tend to promote the good of the University;
and, to say all in one word, listed in a
vile cabal to dishonour, revile, and abuse their
Chancellor himself. The gentlemen against
whom all this is levelled must, I am persuaded,
hold such senseless and licentious calumnies
in such contempt, that I should not merit their
thanks for attempting seriously to confute them.
And yet I cannot help saying for them, that the
<i>Resolution</i> hinted at in this place was drawn
up with so respectful a regard to the authority
of the Statues, and to the honour and dignity
of our great Chancellor, as, one should think,
might stop the mouth of Malice itself. Yet all
this can be overlooked by our candid Inquirer.
And on what pretence? Why, because some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
of those persons, who came to such a <i>Resolution</i>,
had different sentiments, it seems, of
the expediency of the late regulations from this
writer; and because this claim of Appeals tends
to lessen the authority of the Vice-chancellor.
For this he modestly calls <i>opposing the Chancellor,
and curtailing his power</i>.</p>

<p>Well, then, the crime is now out; and, to
say the truth, if it be a crime, the University is
deeply involved in it. For, when the late <i>regulations</i>
were first proposed to the consideration
of the Senate, a considerable majority
were clearly of the same opinion as these culprits:
and, with regard to the present claim,
the University may be almost said to be <i>unanimous</i>
in supporting it. But what in the mean
time must be this scribbler’s sentiments of that
most noble and illustrious person, for whose
honour he here professes himself concerned;
and of whom, it seems, he can think so unworthily,
as to believe, that a liberty in judging
concerning the expediency of some academical
laws, which he had the goodness to propose to
them, should give offence to one who has no
other aim than to serve the University in a
manner the most agreeable to their best judgments;
and which, I am satisfied, they used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
the more freely, on a full persuasion that such
liberty could not be taken as an instance of
disrespect to him. This I should not doubt to
call, of itself, a sufficient confutation of the
idle calumny. But it comes with the worst
grace imaginable from a declared enemy to <i>the
right of Appeals</i>; who must know, if he be
at all acquainted with what passed at that time,
that the principal reason, which induced the
University to oppose the <i>regulations</i>, was the
just apprehension they were under, of an encroachment
on this <i>very right</i>; not indeed
from the Chancellor, who had no such intention,
nor even any knowledge of it, but from
certain forward directors in that affair, who
gave the <i>clearest and least questionable</i> proofs
of their designing to make the <i>new laws</i> the
instruments of their own tyranny in this respect.
So that, if any offence <i>was</i> given by
the University on that occasion, the blame of it
should fall elsewhere, and not on those on
whom it is here so invidiously cast; persons,
who on every occasion have testified the sincerest
honour for their Chancellor, who venerate
him as the protector and patron of the
University, and would humbly co-operate with
him to the attainment of those good ends,
which it is his sole endeavour to promote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<p>But what follows, if possible, is still worse.
A <i>second charge</i> against the University is, that
they are <i>endeavouring to lessen and curtail an
authority, which is only vested in the Vice-chancellor,
as his representative and locum tenens</i>.
What the collective body would return
to this accusation, I pretend not to say; I have
no commission to answer in their name. But,
for myself, and those whose thoughts I have the
opportunity of knowing on this matter, I answer
boldly thus: That we are not in the least
apprehensive of giving offence to this great
person, who is more solicitous for the maintenance
of the just rights of the University than
any other member of it, by any respectful and
moderate endeavours to assert our own reasonable
privileges; that we are well assured,
he approves, and is ready to countenance, all
such honest endeavours; and that, lastly and
<i>chiefly</i>, we are <i>therefore</i> earnest in our endeavours
to lessen an authority (if that must be
called <i>lessening</i> which is but preventing its
being usurped), because it <i>is</i> vested in, and
must be constantly exercised <i>by his representative</i>.
For, whatever liberties he may presume
to take with the assertors of this claim, I will
venture to assure him, that, were unappealable
power itself to be exercised only by our Chancellor,
who is too high in rank, and too noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
in nature, to be under any temptations of
abusing it, though we might still think the authority
unreasonable and dangerous in itself,
we should esteem ourselves in perfect security
under him, and could safely trust the administration
of it to his care. But, as the person
who by our Constitution is vested with it, is
and must be a very imperfect <i>representative</i> of
the Chancellor, in this as well as other respects,
we hope to be forgiven by every equitable
judge, if we are not forward to <i>compliment</i>
ourselves out of our privileges; and have little
inclination to lodge our liberties in less worthy
hands.</p>

<p>After all, one would be glad to know a little
more explicitly of this writer, since he professes
himself so little satisfied with the conduct of
the University, what those <i>clearer and less
questionable testimonies</i> of their regard for the
Chancellor are which he so loudly calls for,
and the want of which, it seems, hath made
his life so distasteful and uneasy to him.
And, I think, I durst almost take upon me
to guess at them. No doubt, they are such
as these: “That the University Senate would
be pleased to make no distinction in any case
between the supreme Magistrate and his representative,
nay, and his representative’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
<i>representatives</i>”—“That they would courteously
give that honour to his <i>locum tenens</i> or <i>locum
tenentes</i>, without perhaps one single merit to
justify such a claim, which the illustrious rank
and dignity of their Chancellor himself, his eminent
virtues, and services to the University, all
conspire to challenge and demand from them:”—In
a word, “that the University would offer
themselves as willing instruments to carry into
execution every paltry project, every low and
selfish design, which little men in office are apt
to form for themselves; and all this under the
notion of its being a tribute of respect to the
supreme Magistrate, and an instance of their
veneration for him.”</p>

<p>Such as these, I can readily believe, are the
<i>testimonies</i> of respect the <i>Inquirer</i> wishes to
see paid to the Chancellor, and which, no doubt,
would administer that sincere pleasure, which
at present he divines (and, I trust, truly) <i>he is
not very likely to have</i>. But does he think the
Chancellor is to be abused by this thin pretence
of respect? that true greatness is to be taken
by this mere outside of an officious and false
compliment? On the other hand, I dare be
confident that nothing is more disgusting to
him than such sycophancy; and that he is so
far from allowing this conduct in the <i>Inquirer</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
that he even disdains to have his cause and
dignity so defended. “For, though (to use
my Lord <i>Bacon’s</i> words on a like occasion) I
observe in his book many glosses, whereby
the man would insinuate himself into his
favour, yet I find it to be ordinary, that many
pressing and fawning persons do misconjecture
of the humour of men in authority; and
many times seek to gratify them with that
which they most dislike.”</p>

<p>But the virulence of these malignant calumnies
hath held me on a very unnecessary argument
too long: I return again to the <i>Inquirer</i>,
to whom I have but one word or two more to
say, and shall then take my final leave of him.</p>

<p>You have talked, Sir, very importantly of
the pernicious consequences of a right of Appeal
in the University. The reasons on which
you would ground these so anxious fears have
been examined, and exposed, as they deserve.
But, granting that some slight, nay, that some
considerable inconveniencies might arise from
it; were this any good argument, think you,
against the subsistence of such a right? What
would become of all the liberties which just
government leaves us, nay, of the blessings and
privileges which indulgent nature bestows upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
us, if the accidental and occasional abuse of
them were thought a reason sufficient to extort
them out of our hands? Should you not have
considered that a <i>right of Appeal</i> is one of the
most important and valuable rights which mankind
enjoy in society, and which, indeed, is
almost essential to the very being of it? And
would you have this sacred claim, <i>patronam
illam et vindicem libertatis</i>, as a great ancient
calls it, rudely and inhumanly wrested from us,
on the frivolous pretence of some possible or
even probable abuse? Had you been as conversant
in the civil law as an <i>Inquirer</i> into such
a question should have been, you might have
found cause to entertain very different opinions
of it. For the great masters in that science
were as well aware as you can be, that such a
right was liable to some abuse; but which of
them ever thought this consideration of force
enough to decry or abolish it? On the other
hand, they <i>acknowledge the inconvenience</i>, yet
assert and vindicate the <i>use</i>. Give me leave to
refer you to one passage (you will find <i>L.</i> 1.
<i>D. De Appell.</i>), very express to this purpose.
“Appellandi usus quam sit frequens quamque
<small>NECESSARIUS</small>, nemo est qui nesciat: quippe
cum iniquitatem judicantium vel imperitiam
re corrigat; <i>licet nonnunquam bene latas sententias
in pejus reformet</i>, neque enim utique<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
melius pronuntiat, qui novissimus sententiam
laturus est.” What will you say, now, to
this? That <i>Ulpian</i>, who affirmed it, was a
factious, turbulent boy? one of those whom
you disgrace under the name of the <i>warm, assertors
of independency</i>, and <i>who bear with indignation
the thought of having any part of
their conduct judicially animadverted upon</i>? I
presume to think you would hardly venture on
this assertion. Nay, I please myself with
hoping, that, when you have well considered
this so sage and venerable sentence of an ancient
Lawyer, you will even be disposed to abate of
your vehemence in declaiming against such as
go on <i>his</i> principles at this day.</p>

<p>Seriously, Sir, it is a bad cause you have
engaged in; and, in mere kindness to you, I
would wish you to relinquish it with all speed.
The claim itself of <i>Appeals</i>, as I have had the
honour to shew you, is of long and ancient
date; indeed as <i>ancient</i> as the Constitution of
the <i>English</i> government itself. Of what consequence
you may chance to be in your political
capacity, it is impossible for me to say; if
you are of any, and should proceed in these
<i>Inquiries</i>, I should go near to apprehend that
the <i>House of Commons</i> itself might take umbrage
at them; for the rise of that great part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
our Constitution is not usually, I think, carried
higher than the point from which the right of
Appeal hath here been deduced. Or, do you
think you may safely make free with the Constitution
of an University, though it were dangerous
meddling with that of the State itself?
This may be true, indeed; but where is your
generosity in the mean time? Why should
the thoughts of impunity encourage you to such
an attack on the rights and privileges of a body
of men, who, though unable to punish such
offences against themselves as they deserve,
have yet been generally secured from all outrage,
by the very regard and reverence which
the public hath ever paid to them? In a word
(for I would not hold you longer from your
<i>necessary avocations</i>), it may be worth your
<i>inquiry</i>, when you shall think fit to sally forth
on another adventure, what the Learned of
<i>Great Britain</i> have done, that they should have
their liberties written and inveighed against in
so outrageous a manner; and, amidst the securest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
enjoyment of every civil right, under the
justest and most equal Government in the
world, what peculiar circumstances of offence
have so inflamed the guilt of the scholars of this
land, that they, of <i>all</i> his Majesty’s good subjects,
should deserve to be the only slaves.</p>

<h2>AN ADDRESS TO THE REV. DR. JORTIN.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">As</span> great an admirer as I must profess myself
of your writings, I little expected that any of
them would give me the pleasure that I have
just now received from the last of your <span class="smcap">Six
Dissertations on different Subjects</span>.</p>

<p>The other <small>FIVE</small> have doubtless their distinct
merits. But in this, methinks, I see an assemblage,
a very constellation, as it were, of
all your virtues, all that can recommend the
scholar or endear the friend. This last, give
me leave to say, is so unusual a part of a
learned mind’s character, and appears with so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
peculiar a lustre in this discourse, that the
public will not be displeased to have it set
before them in full view, and recommended
to general imitation, with a frankness, which
though it may somewhat disgust your own
delicacy, seems but very necessary on such an
occasion and in such times.</p>

<p>I leave it to others therefore to celebrate the
happiness of your invention, the urbanity of
your wit, the regularity of your plan, the address
with which you conceal the point you
aim at in this Dissertation, and yet the pains
you take in seeming obliquely to make your
way to it. These and many other beauties
which your long study of the ancients hath
enabled you to bring into modern composition,
have been generally taken notice of in your
other writings, and will find encomiasts enough
among the common herd of your readers. The
honour I propose to do you by this address is of
another kind; and as it lies a little remote from
vulgar apprehension, I shall have some merit
with you for displaying it as it deserves.</p>

<p>To come to a point then, next to the total
<i>want</i> of <small>FRIENDSHIP</small> which one has too much
reason to observe and lament in the great
scholars of every age, nothing hath at any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
time disgusted me so much as the gross indelicacy
with which they are usually seen to
conduct themselves in their <i>expression</i> of this
virtue.</p>

<p>I have by me a large collection of the civil
things which these lettered friends have been
pleased to say of one another, and it would
amaze you to see with what an energy and
force of language they are delivered. One
thing I thought very remarkable, that the
greater the parts and the more unquestioned
the learning and abilities of the encomiast, just
so much the stronger, that is to say, according
to the usual acceptation, just so much the
more <i>friendly</i> are his encomiums.</p>

<p>I have a great example in my eye. A man,
for instance, hath a bosom <small>FRIEND</small>, whom he
takes for a person of the purest and most benevolent
virtue, presently he sets him down
for such, and publisheth him to all the world.—Or
he hath an intimacy with an eminent
<span class="smcap">Poet</span>: and no regard to decency restrains him
from calling him a great genius, as Horace,
you know, did his friend Virgil, almost to his
face.—Or, he is loved and honoured by a
great <span class="smcap">Lawyer</span> or two; and then be sure all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
fine things that have been said of your <span class="smcap">Ciceros</span>,
your <span class="smcap">Scævolas</span> on your <span class="smcap">Hydes</span>, are squandered
away upon them.—Or, he hath perchance the
honour of being well with a great <span class="smcap">Churchman</span>,
much famed for his political and religious services;
down he goes at once for a lover of his
country, and the scourge of infidels and freethinkers,
with as little reserve as if he had a
<span class="smcap">Jerom</span> or a father <span class="smcap">Paul</span> to celebrate.—Or,
once or twice in his life it hath been his fortune
to be distinguished by great <span class="smcap">Ministers</span>.
Such occasions are rare. And therefore a little
gratitude, we will say, is allowable. But can
any thing be said for abominable formal <i>dedications</i>?—Or,
lastly, he thinks he sees some
sparks of virtue even in his ordinary acquaintance,
and these, as fast as he observes them he
gathers up, and sticks, on the first occasion,
in some or other of his immortal volumes.</p>

<p>O Doctor Jortin! if you did but see half
the extravagancies I have collected of this sort
in the single instance of one man, you would
stand aghast at this degree of corruption in
the learned world, and would begin to apprehend
something of your great merit in
this seasonable endeavour to put a stop to its
progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>

<p>And what above all grieves me is that this
is no <i>novel</i> invention; for then it might well
have ranked with the other arguments of degeneracy
so justly chargeable on the present
times; but the all-accomplished ancients themselves
have, to own the truth, set the example.</p>

<p>I took notice just now of the <span class="smcap">Ingenium ingens</span>
of Horace. The other poets of that time
abound in these fulsome encomiums. But I
am even shocked to think that such men as
<span class="smcap">Cicero</span> and <span class="smcap">Pliny</span>, men so perfect, as they
were, in the commerce of the world, and
from their rank and station, so practised in all
the decencies of conversation, were far gone
in the folly. And yet there are, in truth,
more instances of this weakness in their writings
than in those of any modern I can readily call
to mind.</p>

<p>Something I know hath been said in excuse
of this <i>illiberal manner</i>, from the <small>VIEWS</small> and
<small>CHARACTERS</small> and <small>NECESSITIES</small> of those that use
it. And my unfeigned regard for the professors
of learning makes me willing that any thing
they have to offer for themselves should be
fairly heard.</p>

<p>They say then, and with some appearance
of truth, that as all the benefit they propose to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
themselves by their labours is for the most part
nothing more than a little <i>fame</i> (which whether
good or bad, as the poet observes,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">——begins and ends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the small circle of our foes or friends.)<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>they think it hard to be denied this slender
recompence, which each expects in his turn,
and should therefore be not unwilling to pay
to others.</p>

<p>They, further, alledge, that as they are
generally <i>plain men</i>, much given to speak
their mind, and quite unpractised in the arts
of that chaste reserve and delicate self-denial,
to which some few of their order have happily
habituated themselves, they hope to be forgiven
so natural an infirmity, to which the
circumstances of their situation and character
fatally expose them.</p>

<p>But, lastly, they say, this practice is in a
manner forced upon them by the <i>malignity of
the times</i>. Let a learned man deserve ever so
well of the public, none but those who are
known to be of his acquaintance think themselves
at all concerned to take notice of his
services. Especially this is observed to be the
constant humour of our countrymen, who
rarely speak well of any but their friends, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
our polite neighbours rarely speak ill of any
but their enemies. Now this malevolent disposition
of the learned makes it necessary, they
pretend, that such of them as are connected
by any bond of friendship should be indulged
the greater liberty of commending one another.
Unless you will utterly exclude all intercourse
of praise and panegyric from human society,
which they humbly conceive may be attended
with some few inconveniencies. To strengthen
this last observation they even add, that the
public is usually more shy in bestowing its
praises on writers of eminent and superior merit
than on others. As well knowing, I suppose,
that posterity will make them ample
amends for any mortification they may meet
with at present; and that in the mean time
they are more than sufficiently honoured by
the constant railings and invectives of the
dunces. Lastly, they observe, that in the
more frivolous and easy kinds of learning, such
for instance as are conversant about the collation
of <small>MSS</small>, the rectification of <small>POINTS</small>, and
the correction of <small>LETTERS</small>, the general and
approved custom is for all professors of this
class, whether friends or enemies, to cry up
each other as much as they please, and that it
is even reckoned a piece of incivility not to
preface a citation from ever so insignificant a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
dealer in verbal criticism with some superlative
appellation. And why, say they, should these
nibblers of old books, “<i>These word-catchers
that live on syllables</i>,” be indulged in this
amplitude of expression to one another, when
they who furnish the materials on which the
spawn of these vermin are to feed in after-ages,
are denied the little satisfaction of a more sizeable,
as well as a more deserved praise?</p>

<p>I have not been afraid, you see, to set the
arguments of these unhappy advocates for
themselves in as strong a light as they will
well bear, because I can easily trust your sagacity
to find out a full and decisive answer
to them.</p>

<p>In the <i>first</i> place, you will refer these idolaters
of <small>FAME</small>, for their better information, to
that curious discourse on this subject, which
makes the <i>fourth</i> in the present collection.
Next you will tell them that you by no means
intend to deprive them of their just praise, but
that they must not set up for judges in their
own case, and presume to think how much
of it they have reason to look for from their
friends. You will further signify to them that
the truest office of friendship is to be sparing
of commendation, lest it awaken the envy of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
malicious world; that there is a kind of fascination
in praise which wise men have been
justly suspicious of in all ages; and that a grain
or two from those who are not used to be prodigal
of this incense, is an offering of no small
value. But chiefly and lastly, you will give
them to understand that true honour is seated
not in the mouths but in hearts of men; and
that, for any thing they know, one may be
forced to entertain the highest possible esteem
of their virtues, though, for their sakes, and
for other wise reasons, one has that virtuous
command of one’s tongue and pen as not to
acquaint them with it.</p>

<p>Then, as to the <i>plainness</i> and <i>openness of
mind</i> which is said to make a part in the composition
of a man of letters, you will tell them
that this is the very foible you most lament,
and most wish them to correct: that it exposes
them to much censure and many other inconveniencies;
that this frankness of disposition
makes them bestow their praises on those
whom the world has no such esteem for, or
whom it would rather see left in obscurity and
oblivion; that they often disgust their betters
by this proceeding, who have their reasons for
desiring that a cloud may remain on the characters
of certain obnoxious and dangerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
writers; that by such warm and unmanaged
commendations they become partners, as it
were, of their ill deserts; that they even make
themselves answerable for their future conduct;
which is a matter of so very nice a consideration,
that the great master of life, though he
had not the virtue always to act up to his own
maxim, delivers it for a precept of special use
in the commerce of the world,</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Qualem commendes etiam atque etiam
adspice.</span></p>

</blockquote>

<p>For it signifies nothing in the case before us,
whether the recommendation be to a patron or
the public.</p>

<p>For all these reasons you will assure them
that this ill habit of speaking their mind on all
occasions, just as nature and blind friendship
dictate, is that which more than any thing else
exposes them to the contempt of knowing and
considerate men.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, with regard to that other frivolous
plea taken from the <i>malignity of mankind</i> and
even those of their own family and profession,
you will convince them that this is totally a
mistake, that the world is ready enough to
take notice of superior eminence in letters, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
it is even apt to grow extravagant in its admiration,
and that this humour of the public is
itself a reason for that reserve with which their
friends, if they truly merit that name, ought
to conduct themselves towards them: that this
splendour of reputation, which is so generally
the consequence of distinguished learning, requires
to be allayed and softened by the discrete
management of those who wish them
well, lest it not only grow offensive to weak
eyes, but dazzle their own with too fond an
imagination of their own importance, and so
relax the ardour of their pursuits, or betray
them into some unseemly ostentation of their
just merits. You will farther suggest, that
great atchievements in letters are sufficiently
recompenced by the silent complacency of self-esteem
and of a good conscience; while lesser
services demand to be brought out and magnified
to public eye, for the due encouragement
and consolation of those who would
otherwise have but small reason to be satisfied
with themselves. You might even observe,
that silence itself is often a full acknowledgment
of superior desert, especially when personal
obligations, as well as other reasons,
might provoke them to break through it. In
such cases it is to be understood, that, if a
friend be sparing of his good word, it is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
violence to his inclination, and that nothing
but the tender apprehension of pushing an
acknowledged merit too far, withholds him
from giving a public testimony to it. But, in
conclusion, you will not omit to set them right
with regard to one material mistake in this
matter; that whereas they complain of the
superior estimation in which the professors of
verbal criticism are held amongst us, whom
with a strange malignity they affect to represent
as the very lowest retainers to science,
you, and all true scholars, on the other hand,
maintain that the <i>study</i> of words is the most
useful and creditable of all others; and that
this genuine class of learned men have reason
to pride themselves in their objected, but truly
glorious character of <small>VERBAL CRITICS</small>.</p>

<p>And now, Sir, having seen how little can
be said in justification of that offensive custom
which the learned have somehow taken up, of
directly applauding one another, I come to the
more immediate purpose of this address, which
was to shew how singularly happy you have
been in avoiding this great vice, and to take
occasion from the example you have now set
us to recommend the contrary virtue to the
imitation of others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span></p>

<p>I am sensible there are some difficulties to
be encountered at setting out. A generous
mind will probably feel some reluctance, at
first, to the scheme of suppressing his natural
feelings, and of withholding from his friend
that just tribute of praise which many others
perhaps are but too willing should be withheld
from him. But all scruples of this sort will be
got over when the full merit of your example
hath been considered; I mean, when the inducements
you had to give into the common
weakness on this occasion come to be fairly
drawn out; by which it will be clearly seen
that you have the glory of setting a precedent
of the most heroic magnanimity and self-denial,
and that nothing can possibly be urged in the
<i>case</i> of any other, which you have not triumphantly
gotten the better of in your own.</p>

<p>I observe it to your honour, Sir, you have
ventured on the same ground in this famous
Dissertation, which hath been trodden by the
most noted, at least, of our present writers.
But this is not enough. It will be of moment
to consider a little more particularly the <i>character</i>
of the person whom you chuse to follow,
or rather nobly emulate, in this route. And
lest you should think I have any design to
lessen the merit of your conduct towards him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
by giving it in my cool way, take it from one
of those <i>warm</i> friends who never balk their
humour in this sort of commendations. Upon
asking him what he thought of the learned
person’s character, and telling him the use I
might perhaps make of his opinion in this address
to you, he began in a very solemn way.</p>

<p>“The author of the D. L.” says he, “is a
writer whose genius and learning have so far
subdued envy itself (though it never rose
fiercer against any man, or in more various
and grotesque shapes), that every man of
sense now esteems him the ornament, and
every good man the blessing, of these times.”</p>

<p>Hold, said I, my good friend, I did not mean
to put your eloquence to the stretch for this
panegyric on his <i>intellectual</i> endowments, which
I am very ready to take upon trust, and, to say
the truth, have never heard violently run down
by any but very prejudiced or very dull men.
His <i>moral</i> qualities are those I am most concerned
for.</p>

<p>“His <i>moral</i>,” resumed he hastily, “shine
forth as strongly from all his <i>writings</i> as the
other, and are those which I have ever reverenced
most. Of these, his love of letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
and of virtue, his veneration of great and
good men, his delicacy of honour in not assuming
to himself, or depressing, the merit of
others, his readiness to give their due to all
men of real desert whose principles he opposes,
even to the fastidious, scoffing Lord
<span class="smcap">Shaftesbury</span> and the licentious <span class="smcap">Bayle</span>, but
above all, his zeal for religion and for truth,
these are qualities which, as often as I look
into his volumes, attract my admiration and
esteem. Nor is this enumeration, though it
be far from complete, made at random. I
could illustrate each of these virtues by various
instances, taken from his works, were
it not that the person you mean to address is
more conversant in them, and more ready, I
may presume, to do him justice on any fitting
occasion than myself. The liberty indeed he
takes of dissenting from many great names is
considerable, as well as of speaking his free
thoughts of the writers for whom he hath no
esteem. But the <i>one</i> he doth with that respect
and deference, and the <i>other</i> with that
reason and justice, and <i>both</i> with that ingenuous
openness and candour, the characteristics
of a truly great mind, that they,
whom he opposes, cannot be angry, and they
whom he censures are not misused. I mention
this the rather on account of the clamour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
which has so frequently been raised
against the freedom and severity of his pen.
But there is no mystery in the case. No dead
writer is so bad but he has some advocates,
and no living one so contemptible but he has
some friends. And the misfortune is, that,
while the present generation is too much
prejudiced to do him right, posterity, to whom
the appeal of course lies, are not likely to
have it in their power to re-judge the cause:
the names and writings, he most undervalues,
being such as are hastening, it seems, to that
oblivion which is prepared for such things.</p>

<p>“These,” continued he, “are some of the
obvious qualities of the <small>WRITER</small>; and for the
personal virtues of the <small>MAN</small>—But here I
may well refer you to Dr. <span class="smcap">Jortin</span> himself,
who will take a pleasure to assure you, that
his private character is not less respectable
than his public; or, rather, if the one demands
our veneration, that the other must
secure our love. And, yet, why rest the credit
of <small>ONE</small>, when <small>ALL</small> of his acquaintance
agree in this, that he is the easiest in his conversation,
the frankest and most communicative,
the readiest to do all good offices, in
short the friendliest and most generous of
men.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

<p>Thus far our zealous friend. And, though
I know how much you agree with him in your
sentiments, I dare say you cannot but smile at
so egregious a specimen of the high <i>complimentary
manner</i>. But, though one is not to
expect an encomiast of this class will be very
sensible of any defects in the person he celebrates,
yet it cannot be disowned that this
magnified man hath his foibles as well as another.
I will be so fair as to enumerate some
of them.</p>

<p>As he is conscious of <i>intending</i> well, and
even greatly, in his learned labours, he is rather
disposed to think himself injured by malicious
slanders and gross misrepresentations. And
then, as he hath abundantly too much wit,
especially for a great divine, he is apt to say
such things as, though dull men do not well
comprehend, they see reason enough to take
offence at. Besides, he doth not sufficiently
consult his ease or his interest by the observance
of those forms and practices which are in
use amongst the prudent part of his own order.
This, no doubt, begets a reasonable disgust.
And even his friends, I observe, can hardly
restrain their censure of so great a singularity.
“He is so much in his study, they say, that
he hardly allows himself time to make his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
appearance at a levee. Not considering
that <i>illud unum ad laudem cum labore directum
iter qui probaverunt prope jam soli in</i>
<small>SCHOLIS</small> <i>sunt relicti</i>.” These infirmities, it
must be owned, are very notorious in him; to
which it might be added, that he is very indiscreet,
sometimes, in the topics and turn of his
conversation. His zeal for his <small>FRIEND</small> is so
immoderate, that he takes fire even at the most
distant reflection he hears cast upon him. And
I doubt no consideration could withhold him
from contradicting any man, let his quality and
station be what it would, that should hazard a
joke or an argument, in his company, against
<span class="smcap">Religion</span>.</p>

<p>I thought it but just to take notice of these
weaknesses; and there may, perhaps, be some
others, which I do not now recollect. Yet,
on the whole, I will not deny that he may fairly
pass for an able, a friendly, and even amiable
man.</p>

<p>This person then, such as he is, such, at
least, as the zealots represent and you esteem
him, you have the pleasure to call your <small>FRIEND</small>.
Report says, too, that he has more than a common
right to this <i>title</i>: that he has won it by
many real services done to yourself. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
doth the consciousness of all this fire you! and
what pains do I see you take to restrain that
impatient gratitude, which would relieve itself
by breaking forth in the praises of such a
friend!</p>

<p>And yet—in spite of all these incitements
from <i>esteem</i>, from <i>friendship</i>, and from <i>gratitude</i>,
which might prompt you to some extravagance
of commendation, such is the command
you have of yourself, and so nicely do
you understand what belongs to this intercourse
of learned friends, that, in the instance before
us, you do not, I think, appear to have exceeded
the modest proportion even of a temperate
and chaste praise.</p>

<p>I assure you, Sir, I am so charmed with the
beauty of this conduct, that, though it may
give your modesty some pain, I cannot help
uniting the several parts of it, and presenting
the entire image to you in one piece.</p>

<p>I meddle not with the argument of your
elaborate dissertation. It is enough that your
readers know it to be the same with that of another
famous one in the D. L. They will
know, then, that, among the various parts of
that work, none was so likely as this to extort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
your applause. For it is universally, I suppose,
agreed that, for a point in classical criticism,
there is not the man living who hath a keener
relish for it than yourself. And the general
opinion is, that your honoured friend hath a
sort of talent for this kind of writing. Some
persons, I know, have talked at a strange rate.
One or two I once met with were for setting
him much above the modern, and on a level, at
least, with the best of the old, critics. But this
was going too far, as may appear to any
that hath but attentively read and understood
what the judicious Mr. <span class="smcap">Upton</span> and the learned
Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span> have, in their various books and
pamphlets, well and solidly, and with great delight
to many discerning persons, written on
this subject. Yet still I must needs think him
considerably above <span class="smcap">Minellius</span> and <span class="smcap">Farnaby</span>,
and almost equal to old <span class="smcap">Servius</span> himself, except
that, perhaps, one doth not find in him the
singular <i>ingenuity</i><a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> you admire in the last of
these critics.</p>

<p>But be this as it will, it seems pretty well
agreed, that the learned person, though so great
a divine, is a very competent judge, and no
mean proficient in classical criticism. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
are many specimens of his talents in this way
dispersed through the large and miscellaneous
work of the D. L. But the greatest effort of
his genius, they say, is seen in the explanation
of the Sixth Book of the Ænëis. And, with
all its defects, I can easily perceive you were so
struck with it, that it was with the utmost reluctance
you found yourself obliged, by the
regard which every honest critic owes to truth,
and by the superior delicacy of your purpose,
to censure and expose it.</p>

<p>Another man, I can easily imagine, would
have said to himself before he had entered on
this task, “This fine commentary, which sets
the most finished part of the Ænëis, and indeed
the whole poem, in so new and so advantageous
a light, though not an essential in
it, is yet a considerable ornament of a justly
admired work. The author, too, is my particular
friend; a man, the farthest of all
others from any disposition to lessen the reputation
of those he loves. The subject hath
been well nigh exhausted by him; and the
remarks I have to offer on his scheme are
not, in truth, of that consequence as to
make it a point of duty for me to lay aside
the usual regards of friendship on their account:
and, though <small>HE</small> hath greatness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
mind enough not to resent this liberty, his
impatient and ill-judging friends will be likely
to take offence at it. The public itself, as
little biassed as it seems to be in his favour,
may be even scandalized at an attempt of
this nature, to which no important interest
of religion or learning seem to oblige me.”</p>

<p>After this manner, I say, would a common
man have been apt to reason with himself. But
you, Sir, understand the <i>rights</i> of literary freedom,
and the <i>offices</i> of sacred friendship, at
another rate. The <i>one</i> authorize us to deliver
our sentiments on any point of literature without
reserve. And the <i>other</i> will not suffer you
to dishonour the man you love, or require you
to sully the purity of your own virtue, by a
vicious and vulgar complaisance.</p>

<p>Or, to give the account of the whole matter
in your own memorable words:</p>

<p>The Sixth Book of the Ænëis, you observe,
though the most finished part of the twelve, is
certainly obscure. “Here then is a field open
for criticism, and all of us, who attempt to
explain and illustrate Virgil, have reason to
<small>HOPE</small> that we may make some <i>discoveries</i>,
and to <small>FEAR</small> that we may fall into some <i>mistakes</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
and this should induce us to conjecture
with <i>freedom</i>, to propose with <i>diffidence</i>,
and to dissent with <i>civility</i>. Ἀγαθὴ δ’ ἔρις
ἥδε βροτοῖσι, quoth old Hesiod<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>.”</p>

<p>Which shall I most admire, the dignity, the
candour, or the prudence, that shine forth in
this curious paragraph, which stands as a sort
of preface to the refutation, as no doubt you
designed it, of your friend’s work? “<i>You have
reason to hope that</i>, after the unsuccessful
efforts of the author of the D. L., <i>you may
make some discoveries</i>.” In this declaration
some may esteem you too sanguine. But I see
nothing in it but a confidence very becoming a
man of your talent at a <i>discovery</i>, and of your
importance in the literary world. You add,
indeed, as it were to temper this boldness, that
“<i>you have reason to fear too that you may fall
into some mistakes</i>.” This was rather too
modest; only it would serve, at the same time,
to intimate to your friend what he had to expect
from the following detection of his errors.
But you lead us to the consequence of these
principles. “<i>They should induce us</i>, you say
”<small>TO CONJECTURE WITH FREEDOM</small>.” Doubtless.
And the dignity of your character is seen in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
taking it. For, shall the authority or friendship
of any man stand in the way of my conjectures?</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">——scilicet, ut non<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sit mihi prima fides; et verè quod placet, ut non<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acriter elatrem!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>—“<span class="smcap">To propose with diffidence.</span>” Certainly
very <i>prudent</i>, especially for one sort of
<i>free-conjecturers</i>; and, by the way, no bad hint
to the person you glance at, whose vice it is
thought to be, above that of most other writers,
never to trouble himself with composing a book
on any question, of whose truth he is not previously
and firmly convinced——“<span class="smcap">And to
dissent with civility</span>.” A <i>candid</i> insinuation,
which amounts to this, “That, when
a writer hath done his best to shew his learning
or his wit, the man at whose expence it
is, especially if he be a friend, is, in consideration
of such services, not to take it
amiss.”</p>

<p>I have been the freer to open the meaning
of this introductory paragraph, because it lets
us into the spirit with which you mean to
carry yourself in this learned contention. For
a <i>contention</i> it is to be, and to good purpose
too, if old Hesiod be any authority. Ἀγαθὴ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
δ’ ἔρις ἥδε βροτοῖσι, quoth old Hesiod. Though
to make the application quite pat the maxim
should have run thus, Ἀγαθὴ δ’ ἔρις ἥδε φιλοῖσι,
which I do not find in old Hesiod.</p>

<p>However the reason of the thing extends to
both. And as <i>friends</i> after all are but <i>men</i>,
and sometimes none of the best neither, what
need for standing on this distinction?</p>

<p>Yet still the question returns, “Why so
cool in the entrance of this friendly debate?
Where had been the hurt of a little amicable
parlying before daggers-drawing? If a man,
in the true spirit of ancient chivalry, will needs
break a lance with his friend, he might give
him good words at least and shake hands with
him before the onset. Something of this sort
might have been expected, were it only to save
the reputation of <i>dissenting with civility</i>.”</p>

<p>Now in answer to this question, which
comes indeed to the point, and which I hear
asked in all companies, I reply with much
confidence, <i>first</i>, that the very foundation of
it is laid in certain high fantastic notions about
the duties of friendship, and in that vicious
habit of civility that hath so long been prevalent
among learned friends; both which props<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
and pillars of the cause I may presume with
great modesty to have entirely overturned.</p>

<p>But <i>secondly</i> and chiefly I say that the whole
is an arrant misrepresentation; for that you
have indeed proceeded in this affair, with all
that civility and even friendliness that could
in reason be expected from you: I mean so
far as the sobriety and <i>Retenuë</i>, as the French
term it (it is plain the virtue hath not been
very common amongst us from our having no
name to call it by) of a true critical friendship
will allow.</p>

<p>Now there are several ways by which a
writer’s civility to his friend may appear without
giving into the formal way of <i>address</i>: just
as there are several ways of expressing his devotion
to his patron, without observing the
ordinary forms of <i>dedication</i>; of which, to note
it by the way, the latest and best instances I
have met with, are, “A certain thing prefatory
to a learned work, entitled, <i>The Elements
of Civil Law</i>,” and “Those curious
two little paragraphs prefixed to <i>The Six
Dissertations on different Subjects</i>.”</p>

<p>You see the delicacy of the learned is improving
in our days in more respects than one.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
And take my word for it, you have contributed
your share to this good work. For as you
began, so you conclude your volume with a
master stroke of address, which will deserve
the acknowledgment and imitation of all your
brethren, as I now proceed distinctly and with
great exactness of method to unfold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The first</span> way of distinguishing a learned
friend, without incurring the guilt of downright
compliment, is by <i>writing on the same
subject with him</i>. This is an obvious method
of paying one’s court to a great writer. For it
is in effect telling him that the public attention
is raised to the argument he hath been debating;
and that his credit hath even brought
it into such vogue that any prate on the same
subject is sure of a favourable reception. This
I can readily suppose to have been your first
motive for engaging in this controversy. And
the practice is very frequent. So when a certain
edition of <span class="smcap">Shakespear</span> appeared, though
it had been but the amusement of the learned
editor, every body went to work, in good
earnest, on the great poet, and the public was
presently over-run with editions and criticisms
and illustrations of him. Thus too it fared with
the several subjects treated in the D. L. Few
were competent judges of the main argument,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
or disposed to give it a candid interpretation.
But every smatterer had something to say to
this or that occasional disquisition. Thus
<span class="smcap">Sykes</span>, and <span class="smcap">Stebbing</span> grew immortal, and, as
the poet says truly, <i>in their own despite</i>. And
what but some faint glimmering of this <i>bright
reversion</i>, which we will charitably hope may
be still kept in reserve for them, could put it
into the heads of such men as <span class="smcap">Worthington</span>,
H. G. C.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and <span class="smcap">Peters</span>, to turn critics and
commentators on the book of <span class="smcap">Job</span>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Secondly</span>, Though I acknowledge the full
merit of this way of treating a learned friend,
I am rather more taken with another, which is
that <i>of writing against him</i>. For this demonstrates
the esteem one hath of the author’s
work, not only as it may seem to imply a little
generous rivalry or indeed envy, from which infirmity
a truly learned spirit is seldom quite
free, but as it shews the answerer thought it
worth <i>writing against</i>; which, let me assure
you, is no vulgar compliment; as many living
writers can testify, who to this hour are sadly
lamenting that their ill fortune hath never permitted
them to rise to this distinction. Now,
in this view of the matter, I must take leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
to think that you have done a very substantial
honour to the author of the famous <i>Discourse
on the</i> <small>VI</small>th <i>book of Virgil</i>, in levelling so long
and so elaborate a disputation against him.
And <small>HE</small>, of all other men, ought to be of my
mind, who to my certain knowledge hath
never done thus much for one in a hundred of
those learned persons whose principal end in
commencing writers against him was to provoke
him to this civility.</p>

<p>But then, <small>THIRDLY</small>, this compliment of
<i>writing against</i> a great author may be conveyed
with that address, that he shall not appear, I
mean to any but the more sagacious and discerning,
to be <i>written against</i> at all. This
curious feat of <i>leger-de-main</i> is performed <i>by
glancing at his arguments without so much as
naming the person or referring to him</i>. This
I account the most delicate and flattering of
all the arts of literary address, as it expresseth
all the respect, I have taken notice of under
the preceding article, heightened with a certain
awe and fear of offence, which to a liberal
mind, I should think, must be perfectly irresistible.
It is with much pleasure I observe
many examples of this kind in your truly candid
dissertation, where without the least reference,
or under the slight cover of—<i>some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
friends of Virgil say</i><a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>—<i>some commentators have
thought</i><a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>—<i>Virgil’s friends suppose</i><a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>—and the
like, you have dexterously and happily slid in
a censure of some of your friend’s principal
reasonings. But, to be impartial, though you
manage this matter with admirable grace, the
secret is in many hands. And whatever be
the cause, hath been more frequently employed
in the case of the author of the D. L. than any
other. I could mention, at least, a dozen
famous writers, who, like the flatterers of Augustus,
don’t chuse to look him full in the
face, but artfully intimate their reverence of
him by indirect glances. If I single out one
of these from all the rest it is only to gratify
the admirers of a certain eminent <small>PROFESSOR</small><a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
who, as an Oxford friend writes me word,
hath many delightful instances of this sort in
his very edifying discourses on the <span class="smcap">Hebrew
poetry</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fourthly</span>, Another contrivance of near affinity
to this, is, when you oppose his principles
indeed, <i>but let his arguments quite alone</i>. Of
this management a wary reader will discover
many traces in your obliging discourse. And can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
any thing be more generous than to ease a man
of the shame of seeing his own reasonings confuted,
or even produced when the writer’s
purpose requires him to pay no regard to them?
Such tenderness, I think, though it is pretended
to by others, can, of right, belong
only to the true friend. But your kindness
knows no bounds. For,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fifthly</span>, Though you find yourself sometimes
obliged to produce and confute his reasonings,
<i>you take care to furnish him with better
of your own</i>. The delicacy of this conduct
lies in the good opinion, which is insinuated
of the writer’s conclusion, and in the readiness
which you shew to support it even in spite of
himself. There is a choice instance in that
part of your discourse, where agreeing with
your friend that the punishments of <i>Tartarus</i>
are properly <i>eternal</i>, you reject his reason for
that conclusion, but supply him with many
others in its stead.</p>

<p>“This alone will not prove the eternity of
punishments for, <i>&amp;c.</i>—<span class="smcap">But</span> if to this you
add the Platonic doctrine, that very wicked
spirits were never released from <i>Tartarus</i>,
<small>AND</small> the silence of <i>Virgil</i> as to any dismission
from that jail, <small>AND</small> the censure of the <i>Epicureans</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
who objected to religious systems
the eternity of punishments,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Æternas quoniam pœnas in morte timendum</i>;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><small>AND</small> the general doctrine of the mythologists,
<small>AND</small> the opinion of <span class="smcap">Servius</span>, that <span class="smcap">Virgil</span>
was to be taken in this sense, we may conclude
that the punishments in his Tartarus
were probably eternal<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>.”</p>

<p>Never let men talk after this of the niggardliness
of your friendship, when, though you
take from him with one hand, you restore him
five-fold with the other.</p>

<p>After such an overflow of goodness, nothing
I can now advance will seem incredible. I
take upon me to affirm therefore,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sixthly</span>, That it is a mere calumny to say
that you have contented yourself, though you
very well might, with mere <i>negative</i> encomiums.
You can venture on occasion to <i>quote
from your friend in form</i>, and, as it should
seem, with some <i>apparent approbation</i>. An
instance is now before me. You cite what the
author of the D. L. says of “<i>the transformation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
of the ships into sea deities</i>, by which,
says he, <span class="smcap">Virgil</span> would insinuate, I suppose,
the great advantage of cultivating a naval
power, such as extended commerce and the
dominion of the ocean: which in poetical
language is becoming <i>deities of the sea</i>.”</p>

<p>To which you add, “In <i>favour</i> of this opinion
it may be further observed, that <span class="smcap">Augustus</span>
owed his empire in a great measure
to his naval victories<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>.”</p>

<p>Now can any thing be civiler than this, or
more expressive of that amiable turn of mind,
which disposes a man to help forward a lame
argument of his friend, and give it the needful
support of his authority? For it hath been
delivered as a maxim by the nice observers of
decorum, that wherever you would compliment
another on his opinion, you should
always endeavour to add something of your
own that may insinuate at least some little defect
in it. This management takes of the appearance
of <i>flattery</i>, a vice which the Latin writers,
alluding to this frequency of unqualified assent,
have properly enough expressed by the word
<span class="smcap">Assentatio</span>. But catch you tripping in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
way if one can. It is plain you went on this
just principle in the instance before us, which
otherwise, let me tell you, I should have taken
for something like an attempt towards downright
adulation. As here qualified, I set it
down for another instance of just compliment,
more direct indeed than the other <i>five</i>, yet still
with that graceful obliquity which they who
know the world, expect in this sort of commerce.
And I may further observe, that you
are not singular in the use of this mode of celebration.
Many even of the enemies of this
author have obligingly enough employed it
when they wanted to confirm their own notions
by his, or rather to shew their parts in first
catching a hint from him, and then, as they
believe, improving upon it—Still I have
greater things in view. For,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seventhly</span>, You not only with the highest
address insinuate a compliment in the way
of citation, but you once or twice <i>express
it in full form</i>, and with all the circumstance
of panegyrical approbation. Having mentioned
the case of the infants in Virgil’s purgatory,
which hath so much perplexed his learned
commentators, you rise at once into the following
encomium. “It is an <i>ingenious</i> conjecture
proposed in the D. L. that the poet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
might design to discountenance the cursed
practice of exposing and murdering infants.”</p>

<p>This was very liberal, and I began to think
you had forgotten yourself a little in so explicit
a declaration. But the next paragraph relieved
me. “It might be added, that Virgil had
perhaps <i>also</i> in view to please Augustus, who
was desirous of encouraging matrimony and
the education of children, and extremely
intent upon repeopling Italy which had been
exhausted by the civil wars<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.” It is plain
you have still in your eye that sage rule which
the men of manners lay down, of <i>qualifying</i>
your civilities. So that I let this pass without
farther observation. Only I take leave to warn
you against the too frequent use of this artifice,
which but barely satisfies for calling your
friend’s notion “<i>an ingenious conjecture</i>.”</p>

<p>Not but are there others who see this contrivance
in another light, and treat it as an art
of <i>damning with faint praise</i>; a censure which
one of the zealot friends presumes to cast, with
much injustice and little knowledge of the
world, on the very leader and pride of our
party. Whereas I deliver it for a most certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
truth, that the fainter and feebler our praise
of any man is, just so much the better will it
be received by all companies, even by the generality
of those who call themselves his best
friends. And so apprehensive indeed am I of
this nice humour in mankind, that I am not
sure if the very slight things I am forced to say
of yourself, though merely to carry on the purpose
of this address, will not by certain persons,
inwardly at least, be ill taken. And
with this needful apology for myself I proceed
to celebrate,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eighthly</span>, The last and highest instance of
your civilities to your admired friend, which
yet I hope to vindicate from any reasonable
suspicion of flattery; I presumed to say in the
foregoing article that you had <i>once or twice</i>
hazarded even a direct compliment on the person
whose system you oppose. I expressed
myself with accuracy. There is <i>one other</i> place
in your dissertation, where you make this
sacrifice to friendship or to custom. The passage
is even wrought up into a resemblance of
that unqualified adulation, which I condemn
so much, and from which, in general, your
writings are perfectly free. I could almost
wish for your credit to suppress this one obnoxious
paragraph. But it runs thus,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span></p>

<p>“That the subterraneous adventures of
Æneas were intended by Virgil to represent
the <i>initiation</i> of his heroe, is an <i>elegant</i> conjecture,
which hath been laid before the
public, and set forth to the best advantage
<i>by a learned friend</i><a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.”</p>

<p>I confess to you I did not know at first sight
what to do with the two high-flown epithets,
<i>elegant</i> and <i>learned</i>, which stand so near together
in one sentence. Such accumulated
praises had well-nigh overset my system. And
I began with much solicitude to consider how
I should be able to reconcile this escape of
your pen with your general practice. But
taking a little time to look about me, I presently
spied a way of extricating both of us
from this difficulty. For hang it, thought I,
if this notion of the heroe’s adventures in the
infernal regions be <i>elegant</i>, it is but a conjecture;
and so poor a matter as this were hardly
worth pursuing, as the author of the D. L.
hath done, through almost a fourth part of a
very sizeable volume.</p>

<p>And then as to the term <i>elegant</i>, to be sure
it hath a good sound; but more than a <i>third</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
part of this choice volume of yours, I observed,
is employed in making appear that the conjecture,
whatever it be, hath not the least feature
of <i>truth</i> in it. And <i>elegance</i>, altogether devoid
of truth, was, I concluded, a very pitiful
thing, and indeed no very intelligible encomium.
Well, but let there be as little truth
as you will, in this conjecture, still it <i>hath
been set forth to the best advantage</i>, and to
crown all <i>by a learned friend</i>. Here a swarm
of fresh difficulties attacked me. <i>Sed nil desperandum
te duce.</i> For why talk of <i>advantage</i>,
when the conjecture after all would not bear
the handling? It was but mighty little (your
friendship would not let you do more) which
you had brought against it. And the conjecture
I saw, was shrunk to nothing, and is
never likely to rise again into any shape or
substance. So that when you added <i>by a
learned friend</i>, I could not for my life, help
laughing. Surely, thought I, the reverend
person tends on this occasion to be pleasant.——Indeed
you often are so with a very
good grace, but I happened not to expect it
just at this moment.—For what <i>learning</i>
worth speaking of could there be in the support
of a notion, which was so easily overturned
without any?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>

<p>You may be sure I mean no reflection in
these words. Nobody questions your erudition.
But it was not your fortune or your
choice to make a shew of it in this discourse.
The propriety of the epithet <i>learned</i>, then, did
not evidently and immediately appear.</p>

<p>However, as I knew there was in truth no
small quantity of learning in the piece referred
to, and that the author of the D. L. whatever
<span class="smcap">Bate</span>, and <span class="smcap">Peters</span>, and <span class="smcap">Jackson</span>, may say or
insinuate, is unquestionably, and to a very
competent degree, learned, I began to take the
matter a little more seriously. And, upon looking
attentively at the words a second time, I
thought a very natural account might be given
of them upon other principles. For, as to the
substantive <i>friend</i>, why might not that for once
be put in for your own sake as well as his?
The advantages of friendship are reciprocal.
And though it be very clear to other people
which is the gainer by this intercourse, who
knows but Dr. <span class="smcap">Jortin</span>, in his great modesty,
might suppose the odds to lie on his own side?</p>

<p>And then for <i>learned</i>, which had embarrassed
me so much, I bethought myself at last
there was not much in that, this attribute having
been long prostituted on every man who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
pretends, in any degree, to the profession of
letters.</p>

<p>So that, on the whole, though I must still
reckon this for an instance, amongst others, of
that due measure of respect with which your
politeness teaches you to treat your friends, yet
I see no reason for charging it with any excess
of civility.</p>

<p>And now, Sir, having been at all this pains
to justify you from the two contrary censures
of having done <i>too little</i> and <i>too much</i>, let us
see how the account stands. Malice itself, I
think, must confess that you have not been
lavish of your encomiums. You have even
dispensed them with a reserve, which, though
I admire extremely, will almost expose you to
the imputation of <i>parsimony</i>. And yet, on the
other hand, when we compute the number and
estimate the value of your applauses, we shalt
see cause to correct this censure. For, from
the <small>EIGHT</small> articles I have so carefully set down,
and considered, it appears at length that you
have done all due honour to your friend, and
in ways the most adapted to do him honour.
That is to say, <i>You have adopted his subject—You
have written against him—You have
glanced at him—You have spared his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
arguments—You have lent him some of your own—You
have quoted him—You have called his
conjecture ingenious—Nay elegant—And you
have called himself learned</i>, and, what is more,
<i>your friend</i>.</p>

<p>And if all this will not satisfy him, or rather
his friends (for I hope, and partly believe, he
himself thinks nothing of this whole matter), I
know not for my part what will. I am sure
(and that should be your satisfaction, as it is
mine) that you have gone as far as was consistent
with the <i>delicacy</i> of friendship (which
may reasonably imply in it a little jealousy),
and with the virtuous consciousness of that
importance which writers of your class ought
to be of to themselves. And I hope never to
see the day when you shall be induced by any
considerations to compliment any man breathing
at the expence of these two virtues.</p>

<p>And here, on a view of this whole matter,
let me profess the pleasure I take in observing
that you (and I have remarked it in some
others), who have so constantly those soft
words of <i>candour</i>, <i>goodness</i>, and <i>charity</i> in your
mouth, and whose soul, one would think, was
ready to melt itself into all the weaknesses of
this character, should yet have force enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
not to relent at the warmest influences of
<i>friendship</i>. Men may see by this instance that
<i>charity</i> is not that unmanly enfeebling virtue
which some would represent it, when, though
ready on fit occasions to resolve and open itself
to a <i>general</i> candour, it shuts up the heart close
and compact, and impregnable to any <i>particular</i>
and personal attachment.</p>

<p>I take much delight in this pleasing contemplation.
Yet, as our best virtues, when pushed
to a certain degree, are on the very point of
becoming vices, you are not to wonder that
every one hath not the discernment or the
justice to do you right. And to see, in truth,
the malignity of human nature, and the necessity
there was for you to inculcate in your <i>third</i>
Discourse, <i>The duty of judging candidly and
favourably of others</i>, I will not conceal from
you, at parting, what hath been suggested to
me by many persons to whom I communicated
the design of this address. “They said,” besides
other things which I have occasionally
obviated in the course of this letter, “that the
excellent person whom you have allowed yourself
to treat with so much indignity and disrespect
(I need not take notice that I use the
very terms of the objectors), in this poor and
disingenuous criticism upon him, had set you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
an example of a very different sort, which you
ought in common equity, and even decency,
to have followed.” They observe that his own
pen never expatiates more freely, and with
more pleasure, than when it finds or takes an
occasion to celebrate the virtues of some deserving
friend. They own the natural warmth
and benevolence of his temper is even liable to
some excess on these inviting occasions. And
for an instance they referred me to a paragraph
in the notes on <i>Julian</i>, which, though I know
you do not forget, I shall here set down as it
stands in the last edition. He had just been
touching a piece of ecclesiastical history. “But
this,” says he, “I leave with Julian’s adventures
to my learned friend Mr. <span class="smcap">Jortin</span>,
who, I hope, will soon oblige the public with
his curious Dissertations on Ecclesiastical
Antiquity, composed like his Life, not in the
spirit of <i>controversy</i>, nor, what is worse, of
<i>party</i>, but of <i>truth</i> and <i>candour</i><a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.”</p>

<p>Here, said they insultingly, is a specimen of
that truly liberal spirit with which one learned
friend should exert himself when he would do
honour to another. Will all the volumes which
the profound ecclesiastical remarker hath published,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
or ever will publish, do him half the
credit with posterity as this single stroke, by
which his name and virtues are here adorned
and ushered into the acquaintance of the public?
And will you still pretend to vindicate
him from the scorn which every honest man
must have for him, after seeing how unworthily
he requites this service by his famous <span class="smcap">Sixth
Dissertation</span> in this new volume?</p>

<p>This, and a great deal more to the same purpose,
was said by them in their tragical way.
I need not hint to you, after the clear exposition
I have given of my own sentiments, how
little weight their rhetoric had on me, and how
easily I turned aside this impotent, though invenomed,
invective from falling on your fame
and memory. For the <i>compliment</i> they affect
to magnify so much, let every candid reader
judge of it for himself. But, as much had
been said in this debate concerning <small>FRIENDSHIP</small>,
and the persons with whom it was most proper
to contract it, I found myself something struck
with the concluding observation of one of these
rhetorical declaimers. As it was delivered in a
language you love, and is, besides, a passage
not much blown upon by the dealers in such
scraps, I have thought it might, perhaps, afford
you some amusement. He did not say where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
he found it, and you would not like it the
better if he had, but, as I remember, it was
delivered in these words: Ἐμοὶ πρὸς φιλοσόφους

<h2>A LETTER TO THE REV. DR. LELAND.</h2>

<p>REV. SIR,</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">I have</span> read your <span class="smcap">Dissertation</span> <i>on the principles
of human Eloquence</i>, and shall very
readily, I dare say, be indulged in the liberty,
I am going to take, of giving you my free
thoughts upon it. I shall do it, with all the
regard that is due from one scholar to another;
and even with all the civility which may be
required <small>ONE</small>, who hath his reasons for addressing
you, in this public manner, without
a name.</p>

<p>You entitle your work <i>A Dissertation on
the principles of Eloquence</i>: but the real subject
of it, is an <i>Opinion</i>, or <i>Paradox</i>, as you
chuse to term it, delivered by the Bishop of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
<i>Gloucester</i> in his late discourse <i>on Grace</i>.
This opinion, indeed, concerns, or rather, in
your ideas, subverts, <i>the very principles</i> of
Eloquence, which your office, it seems, in a
learned society obliged you to maintain: so that
you cannot be blamed for giving some attention
to the ingenious Prelate’s paradox, which
so incommodiously came in your way. Only
the more intelligent of your hearers might possibly
think it strange that, in a set of rhetorical
lectures, addressed to them, the <i>Controversial</i>
part should so much take the lead of the <i>Didactic</i>:
or rather, that the <i>Didactic</i> part should
stand quite still, while the <i>Controversial</i> keeps
pacing it, with much alacrity, from one end
of your Dissertation to the other.</p>

<p>Yet neither, on second thoughts, can you
be blamed for this conduct, which one way or
other might serve to the instruction of your
young auditory; if not in <i>the principles of
Rhetoric</i>, yet in a better thing, <i>the principles
of Logic</i>. It might, further, serve to another
purpose, not unworthy the regard of a rhetoric
lecturer. The subject of Eloquence has been
so exhausted in the fine writings of antiquity,
and, what is worse, has been so hackneyed in
modern compilations from them, that your
discourse wanted to be enlivened by the poignant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
controversial air, you have given to it,
and to be made important, by bringing an
illustrious character into the scene.</p>

<p>All this I am ready to say in your vindication,
if your conduct may be thought to require
any. Having, therefore, nothing to object to
the <i>general design</i>, or <i>mode</i> of your dissertation,
I shall confine myself entirely to the
<small>MATTER</small> of it, after acquainting the reader, in
few words, with the occasion and subject Of
this debate.</p>

<p>The Bishop of <i>Gloucester</i>, in late theological
treatise on <i>the doctrine of Grace</i>, which
required him to speak fully to the subject of
<i>inspiration</i>, found it necessary to obviate an
objection to what he conceived to be the right
notion of <i>inspired scripture</i>, which had been
supported by some ingenious men, and very
lately by Dr. <span class="smcap">Middleton</span>. The objection is
delivered by the learned Doctor, in these
words.</p>

<p>“If we allow the gift [of inspired languages]
to be lasting, we must conclude that some
at least of the books of scripture were in this
inspired Greek. But we should naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
expect to find an inspired language to be
such as is worthy of God; that is, pure,
clear, noble and affecting, even beyond the
force of common speech; since nothing can
come from God but what is perfect in its
kind. In short, the purity of <span class="smcap">Plato</span>, and
the eloquence of <span class="smcap">Cicero</span>. Now, if we
try the apostolic language by this rule, we
shall be so far from ascribing it to God, that
we shall scarcely think it worthy of man,
that is, of the liberal and polite; it being
utterly rude and barbarous, and abounding
with every fault that can possibly deform
a language. And though some writers,
prompted by a false zeal, have attempted to
defend the purity of the Scripture-Greek,
their labour has been idly employed<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.” Thus
far the learned <span class="smcap">Doctor</span>.</p>

<p>‘These triumphant observations,’ says the
Bishop, ‘are founded on two propositions, both
of which he takes for granted, and yet neither
of them is true:</p>

<p>‘The one, That an inspired language must
needs be a language of perfect eloquence;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span></p>

<p>‘The other, That eloquence is something
congenial and essential to human speech<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>.’</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Bishop</span> then undertakes to shew the falshood
of these two propositions. <span class="smcap">You</span>, Sir, contend
for the truth of the <i>latter</i>: and controvert the
principles on which the Bishop would confute
the <i>former</i>. That the reader may be enabled
to judge for himself between you, I shall quote
his Lordship’s own words, paragraph by paragraph,
so far as any thing said by him is controverted
by you; and shall then endeavour,
with all care, to pick up the loose ends of your
argument, as I find them any where <i>come up</i>
in the several chapters of your Dissertation;
intermixing, as I go along, such reflexions of
my own, as the occasion may suggest.</p>

<p>‘With regard to the <small>FIRST</small> proposition (resumes
the Bishop) I will be bold to affirm,
that were the <span class="smcap">Style</span> of the New Testament
exactly such as his [Dr. <span class="smcap">Middleton’s</span>] very
exaggerated account of if would persuade us to
believe, namely that it is <i>utterly rude and barbarous,
and abounding with every fault that
can possibly deform a language</i>, this is so far
from proving such language not divinely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
inspired, that it is one certain mark of this
original<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>.’</p>

<p>By the manner, in which the learned Bishop
introduces this <i>affirmation</i>, one sees that he
foresaw very clearly it would be esteemed a
<i>bold</i> one. Nay, in another place<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>, he even
takes to himself the shame, with which some
readers, he well knew, would be forward
enough to cover him, and in one word confesses
his general notion of eloquence to be a
<span class="smcap">Paradox</span>: <i>which yet</i>, says he, <i>like so many
others, I have had the odd fortune to advance,
will be seen to be only another name,
for</i> <span class="smcap">Truth</span>. After this concession, it had been
more generous in you to have omitted some
invidious passages; such as that where you
say, <i>the Bishop in his reply to this objection</i>
[of Dr. <span class="smcap">Middleton</span>] <i>seems to have displayed
that</i> <small>BOLD OPPOSITION TO THE GENERAL OPINIONS
OF MANKIND</small>, <i>by which his learned labours
are distinguished</i>; Intr. p. ii. And again
in p. vii. where you speak of his principles as
<i>paradoxical</i>, and implying <small>AN HARDY OPPOSITION
TO THE GENERAL SENSE OF MANKIND</small>.</p>

<p>But let the <i>boldness</i> of the Bishop’s principles
be what it will, there is small hurt done,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
provided they turn out, what he seems persuaded
they will, only <i>truths</i>. Let us attend
his Lordship, then, in the proof of his <small>FIRST</small>
Paradox.</p>

<p>‘I will not pretend, says he, to point out
which books of the N. T. were, or were not,
composed by those who had the Greek tongue
thus miraculously infused into them; but
this I will venture to say, that the style of a
writer so inspired, who had not (as these
writers had not) afterwards cultivated his
knowledge of the language on the principles
of Grecian eloquence, would be precisely
such as we find it in the books of the New
Testament.</p>

<p>‘For, if this only be allowed, which no one,
I think, will contest with me, that a strange
language acquired by illiterate men, in the
ordinary way, would be full of the idioms of
their native tongue, just as the Scripture-Greek
is observed to be full of Syriasms, and
Hebraisms; how can it be pretended, by
those who reflect upon the nature of language,
that a strange tongue divinely infused
into illiterate men, like that at the day of
Pentecost, could have any other properties
and conditions<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span></p>

<p>Here, the features of this bold paradox begin
to soften a little. We are something reconciled
to it, 1. by being told, what the <i>rudeness
and barbarity</i> is, which is affirmed to be <i>one
certain mark</i> of an inspired language, namely,
<i>its being full of the idioms of the native
tongue</i> of the inspired writer: And 2. by being
told, that these idioms are equally to be expected
whether the new language be infused
by divine inspiration, or acquired by illiterate
men in the ordinary way. In the <i>latter</i> case,
it is presumed, and surely with reason enough
(because experience uniformly attests the fact),
that a strange language, so learnt, would
abound in the native idioms of the learner:
All that remains is to shew, that the event
would be the same, in the <i>former</i>. The Bishop
then applies himself, in order, to this
task.</p>

<p>‘Let us weigh these cases impartially. Every
language consists of two distinct parts; the
single terms, and the phrases and idioms.
The first, as far as concerns appellatives especially,
is of mere arbitrary imposition, though
on artificial principles common to all men:
The second arises insensibly, but constantly,
from the manners, customs, and tempers of
those to whom the language is vernacular;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
and so becomes, though much less arbitrary
(as what the Grammarians call <i>congruity</i> is
more concerned in this part than in the
other), yet various and different as the several
tribes and nations of mankind. The first
therefore is unrelated to every thing but to
the genius of language in general; the second
hath an intimate connexion with the fashions,
notions, and opinions of that people only, to
whom the language is native.</p>

<p>‘Let us consider then the constant way which
illiterate men take to acquire the knowledge
of a foreign tongue. Do they not make it
their principal, and, at first, their only study,
to treasure up in their memory the signification
of the terms? Hence, when they come
to talk or write in the speech thus acquired,
their language is found to be full of their own
native idioms. And thus it will continue, till
by long use of the strange tongue, and especially
by long acquaintance with the owners
of it, they have imbibed the particular genius
of the language.</p>

<p>‘Suppose then this foreign tongue, instead
of being thus gradually introduced into the
minds of these illiterate men, was instantaneously
infused into them; the operation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
(though not the very mode of operating)
being the same, must not the effect be the
same, let the cause be never so different?
Without question. The divine impression
must be made either by fixing the terms or
single words only and their signification in
the memory; as for instance, Greek terms
corresponding to the Syriac or Hebrew; or
else, together with that simple impression,
another must be made, to inrich the mind
with all the ideas which go towards the composing
the phrases and idioms of the language
so inspired: But this latter impression seems
to require, or rather indeed implies, a previous
one, of the tempers, fashions, and opinions
of the people to whom the language is
native, upon the minds of them to whom the
language is thus imparted; because the phrase
and idiom arises from, and is dependent on,
those manners: and therefore the force of expression
can be understood only in proportion
to the knowledge of the manners: and understood
they were to be; the Recipients of this
spiritual gift being not organical canals, but
rational Dispensers. So that this would be a
waste of miracles without a sufficient cause;
the Syriac or Hebrew idiom, to which the
Disciples were enabled of themselves to adapt
the words of the Greek, or any other language,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
abundantly serving every useful purpose,
all which centered in giving <small>CLEAR
INTELLIGENCE</small>. We conclude, therefore, that
what was thus inspired was the <span class="smcap">Terms</span>, together
with that grammatic congruity, which is
dependant thereon. In a word, to suppose such
kind of inspired knowledge of <i>strange tongues</i>
as includes all the native peculiarities, which,
if you will, you may call their <i>elegancies</i>;
(for the more a language is coloured by the
character and manners of the native users,
the more elegant it is esteemed) to suppose
this, is, as I have said, an ignorant fancy,
and repugnant to reason and experience.</p>

<p>‘Now, from what has been observed, it follows,
that if the style of the N. T. were indeed
derived from a language divinely infused
as on the day of Pentecost, it must be just
such, with regard to its style, as, in fact, we
find it to be; that is to say, Greek words very
frequently delivered in Syriac and Hebrew
idiom.</p>

<p>‘The conclusion from the whole is this, that
<i>nominal</i> or <i>local</i> barbarity of style (for that
this attribute, when applied to style, is no
more than nominal or local, will be clearly
shewn under our next head) is so far from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
being an objection to its miraculous acquisition,
that it is one mark of such extraordinary
original<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>.’</p>

<p>I have given this long quotation together,
that the reader may comprehend at one view the
drift and coherence of the Bishop’s argument:
which is so clearly explained that what force it
hath, can receive no addition from any comment
of mine upon it.</p>

<p>It is true, this force appears to you no
mighty matter—“We are told, you say, that,
in order to convey clear intelligence to a foreigner,
nothing more is necessary, than to
use the <i>words</i> of his language adapted to the
<i>idiom</i> of our own. But shall we always find
correspondent words in his language<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>?”</p>

<p>Shall <i>we always find correspondent words</i>?—Not
always, <i>perfectly</i> correspondent. Where
does the Bishop say, we shall? Or, how was
it to his purpose to say it? He does indeed
speak of <i>such a correspondency of terms</i>, and
chiefly <i>of such an adaption of the terms of
one language to the idiom of another</i>, as shall
abundantly serve to give <i>clear intelligence</i>.
And this is all he had occasion to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span></p>

<p>Well, but an exact correspondency of terms
is material. To what? To give <i>clear intelligence</i>?
But if this be true, no clear intelligence
can possibly be given in any translation
from one language into another; for, in all
translations whatever, it is necessary to render
some words by others, that are not perfectly
correspondent. You will scarcely deny that
our English translation of the Gospels conveys,
in general, <i>clear intelligence</i> to the English
reader, though many terms are used in it, and
were of necessity to be used, that do not perfectly
and adequately correspond to the Greek
terms, employed by the sacred writers. Without
doubt it was your purpose to convey <i>clear
intelligence</i> to your English reader in the
elegant translations, they say, you have made
of <span class="smcap">Demosthenes</span>: and yet doubtless you will
acknowledge that many words of the Athenian
orator are not perfectly correspondent
to those employed by you in your version
of them.</p>

<p>What follows from this? Why, either that
all translations must be exploded and set aside
as insufficient to give clear intelligence, or that
we must accept them, with all their unavoidable
imperfections, as, in general, sufficiently
representative of the sense of their originals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
though in some particulars that sense be inadequately
conveyed to us.</p>

<p>But how then, you will say, shall we gain a
clear and perfect intelligence of such particulars?
Why in the way, which common sense
suggests; by inquiring, if we are able, what
the precise meaning is of those terms of the
original language, to which the translated
terms are thus imperfectly correspondent. And
if this be an inconvenience, ’tis an inconvenience
necessarily attending every translation
in the world, in which a writer would express
the mixed modes denoted by the words of any
other. For supposing the Greek tongue, infused
by divine inspiration into the sacred
writers, to have been that of <span class="smcap">Plato</span> or <span class="smcap">Demosthenes</span>
himself, you will hardly pretend
that it could have furnished them with Greek
terms perfectly expressive of such compound
ideas as certain Syriac or Hebrew terms expressed,
and of which their subject obliged
them to give, as far as the nature of the case
would permit, <i>clear intelligence</i>. So that I
cannot for my life comprehend the drift of that
short question, <i>Shall we always find correspondent
terms in a foreign language?</i> or,
the pertinence of your learned comment on
the text of <span class="smcap">Cicero’s</span> letter to <span class="smcap">Servius</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span></p>

<p>I am sensible indeed, that, if the <i>terms</i> only
of the new language were divinely infused,
<i>these</i>, whether perfectly correspondent or not,
would be insufficient of themselves to give clear
intelligence. But the Bishop supposes more
than this to be infused; for, <i>what was inspired,
he tells us, was the terms</i>, <small>TOGETHER</small> <i>with that
grammatic congruity which is dependent
thereon</i>. Now this knowledge of the <i>grammatic
congruity</i> of any tongue, superadded to
a knowledge of its <i>terms</i>, would methinks enable
a writer to express himself in it, for the
most part, <i>intelligibly</i>.</p>

<p>I confess, the Bishop speaks—<i>of fixing the
terms or single words</i> <small>ONLY</small>, <i>and their signification,
in the memory</i>—But then he does
not mean to exclude the <i>grammatic congruity</i>
in the use of them, which, as we have seen, he
expressly requires in the very same paragraph,
but merely to expose the notion of the <i>phrases
and idioms</i> being required, too. His Lordship
speaks of the <i>terms, or single words</i> <small>ONLY</small>, in
opposition to <i>phrases and idioms</i>: you seem
to speak of <i>terms, or single words</i> <small>ONLY</small>, in
opposition to <i>systematic congruity</i>.</p>

<p>I say, you <i>seem</i> so to speak: for, otherwise,
I know not what to make of all you say concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
the insufficiency of the <i>terms only</i> of
any language to give intelligence. And yet,
in what follows, you <i>seem</i> to do justice to the
Bishop, and to admit that, besides the <i>terms</i>,
a <i>grammatic congruity in the use of them</i> was
divinely inspired. For you go on to observe,
“That the real purport of almost every sentence,
in every language, is not to be learned
from the signification of detached words, <i>and
their grammatical congruity</i>, even where
their signification may be expressed by correspondent
words in another language<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.”</p>

<p>And here, Sir, your learning expatiates
through several pages: the purpose of all which
is to shew, that, if the <i>terms</i> of one language,
though <i>congruously used</i>, be strictly adapted
to the <i>idiom</i> of another, still they would give
no intelligence, or at least a very obscure one;
as you endeavour to prove by a <i>decent</i> instance
taken from your countryman, <span class="smcap">Swift</span>, in his
dotages; and another, given by yourself in a
literal version of a long passage of a sacred
writer. It is true, in this last instance, you do
not confine yourself to the strict observance of
<i>grammatic congruity</i>. If you had done this,
it would have appeared, from your own instance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
that <i>intelligence</i> might have been given,
and with tolerable <i>clearness</i> too, even in a literal
version.</p>

<p>But be it allowed, that, if the terms of one
language, even though a congruous construction
be observed, be constantly and strictly
adapted to the <i>idioms</i> of another, the expression
will still, many times, be very dark
and obscure: how is this <i>obscurity</i> to be prevented?
Take what language you will for the
conveyance instruction, it will be necessary
for the reader or hearer to gain a competent
knowledge of its idioms and phraseology, before
he can receive the full benefit of it. So that,
unless there had been a language in the world,
native to all nations, and in the strictest sense
of the word <i>universal</i>, I see not how inspiration
itself could remedy this inconvenience. Suppose,
as I said before, that the inspired language
in which the Apostles wrote had been the
purest Greek, still its <i>idiomatic phraseology</i>
had been as strange and obscure to all such to
whom that language was not native, as the
Syriac or Hebrew idioms, by which the Apostolic
Greek is now supposed to be so much
darkened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span></p>

<p>I conclude upon the whole, that nothing you
have said overturns, or so much as affects, the
learned Prelate’s notion of divine inspiration,
<i>as conveying only the terms and single words
of one language, corresponding to those of another,
together with that grammatic congruity
in the use of them which is dependant thereon</i>.
This <i>first and grand principle</i>, as you call it,
of the Bishop’s new theory, <i>is such</i>, you say, <i>as
no critic or grammarian can admit</i><a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>. On the
contrary, I must presume to think, because I
have now shewn, that no critic or grammarian,
who deserves the name, can reasonably object
to this <i>principle</i>, as it allows all that is necessary
to be supposed of an inspired language,
its sufficiency to give clear intelligence: so
<i>clear</i>, that, had the idioms of the new language
been inspired too, it could not, in the
general view of Providence, who intended this
intelligence for the use of all people and languages,
have been clearer.</p>

<p>But your unfavourable sentiment of the Bishop’s
principle arises from your misconception
of the <i>circumstances</i>, <i>abilities</i>, and <i>qualifications</i>
of the Apostles, when they addressed
themselves to the work of their ministry, and
especially to the work of composing books for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
the instruction of the faithful in this originally
inspired language.</p>

<p>When the Greek language was first infused,
it would, no doubt, be full of their native
phrases, or rather it would be wholly and entirely
adapted to the Hebrew or Syriac idioms.
This would render their expression somewhat
dark and obscure to their Grecian hearers. But
then it would be intelligible enough to those
to whom they first and principally addressed
themselves, the <i>Hellenistic Jews</i>, who, though
they understood Greek best, were generally no
strangers to the Hebrew idiom.</p>

<p>Further still, though this Hebrew-Greek language
was all that was originally infused into
the Apostles, nothing hinders but that they
might, in the ordinary way, improve themselves
in the Greek tongue, and superadd to
their inspired knowledge whatever they could
acquire, besides, by their conversation with the
native Greeks, and the study of their language.
For, though it can hardly be imagined, as the
Bishop says, <i>that the inspired writers had cultivated
their knowledge of the language on the
principles of the Grecian eloquence</i><a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>, that is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
had formed and perfected their style by an
anxious and critical attention to the rules and
practice of the Greek rhetors, yet we need not
conclude that they wholly neglected to improve
themselves in the knowledge and use of this
new language. So that, by the time they turned
themselves to the Gentiles, and still more by
the time they applied themselves to pen the
books of the N. T. they might be tolerable
masters even of the peculiar phraseology of the
Greek tongue, and might be able to adapt it, in
good measure, to the Greek idioms.</p>

<p>All this, I say, is very <i>supposeable</i>; because
their turning to the Gentiles was not till near
<small>TEN</small> years after the descent of the Holy Ghost
upon the Apostles and the date of their earliest
writings, penned for the edification of the
Church, was not till near <small>TWENTY</small> years after
that period: In all which time, they had full
leisure and opportunity to acquire a competent
knowledge of the native idiomatic Greek, abundantly
sufficient to answer all ends of clearness
and instruction.</p>

<p>But I go further, and say, It is not only very
<i>supposeable</i>, and perfectly consistent with all
the Bishop has advanced on the subject of inspiration,
that the sacred writers <i>might</i> thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
improve themselves, but it is, likewise, very
<i>clear</i> and <i>certain</i> that they <small>DID</small>. How else are
we to account for that difference of style observable
in the sacred writers, whose expression
is more or less coloured by their native Hebrew
idioms, according as their acquaintance with
the Greek tongue was more or less perfect?
There were still, no doubt, very many of their
own native idioms interspersed in their most
improved Greek: As must ever be the case of
writers who compose in a foreign tongue, whether
acquired in the ordinary way, or supernaturally
infused into them: But these barbarisms,
as they are called, I mean these Syriasms
or Hebraisms, are not so constant and perpetual
as to prevent their writings from giving
<i>clear intelligence</i>. In short, the style of the
inspired writers is <small>JUST</small> that which we should
naturally expect it to be, on this supposition of
its being somewhat improved by use and exercise,
and which the learned Bishop <i>accurately</i>
(and in perfect <i>consistency</i> with his main
principle, <i>of the terms only being inspired,
with the congruous use of them</i>) defines it to
be, “<i>Greek words</i> <small>VERY FREQUENTLY</small> <i>delivered
in Syriac and Hebrew idiom</i><a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span></p>

<p>Thus, in every view, the Bishop’s <i>grand</i>
principle may be safely admitted. All that we
<i>need</i> suppose, and therefore all that is <i>reasonable</i>
to be supposed, is, <i>That the terms of
the Greek language, and a grammatical congruity
in the use of them</i>, was miraculously infused:
The rest would be competently and sufficiently
obtained by the application of ordinary
means, without a miracle.</p>

<p>After saying so little, or rather after saying
indeed <i>nothing</i>, that affects the Bishop’s principle,
I cannot but think it is with an ill grace
you turn yourself to cavil at the <i>following incidental
observation</i> of his Lordship, which yet
will be found as true and as just as any other
he has made on this subject.</p>

<p>To those who might expect <i>that, besides the
simple impression of the Greek terms only,
and their signification</i> on the minds of the
inspired linguists, <i>another should have been
made to inrich the mind with all the ideas
which go towards the composing the phrases
and idioms of the language so inspired</i> (all
which had been necessary, if the inspired language
had been intended for a perfect model of
Grecian eloquence), the Bishop replies—‘This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
latter impression seems to require, or rather
indeed implies, a previous one of the tempers,
fashions, and opinions, of the people to whom
the language is native, upon the minds of
them to whom the language is thus imparted;
because the phrase and idiom arises from, and
is dependent on those manners<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>.’ But such
an impression as this, he goes on to shew, was
not to be expected.</p>

<p>It is clear from this passage, that the Bishop
is speaking of <i>an impression</i> necessary to be
made on the minds of the Apostles, if the inspired
language had been so complete as to extend
to all its native phrases and idioms. If
the Apostles were instantly to possess the inspired
Greek in this perfection, it is necessary
to suppose that this <i>last</i> impression must, as
well as that of the terms, be made upon them.
Can any thing, be more certain and undeniable
than this <i>affirmation?</i> Yet, in p. 86. of your
book, you have this strange passage.</p>

<p>After having shewn, as you suppose, that the
Bishop’s grand principle, of the inspiration of
the <small>TERMS</small> only, stands on a very insecure foundation,
“Perhaps,” you say, “it is no less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
<small>HAZARDOUS</small> to affirm, that a knowledge of the
idiom or phraseology of any language, <i>always</i>
implies a previous knowledge of the customs
and manners of those to whom it is vernacular.”</p>

<p>You intended, no doubt, in your censure of
this hazardous position, to oppose something
which the Bishop had affirmed. Be pleased
now to cast your eye on the passage you criticize,
and tell me where the Bishop asserts, <i>that
a</i> <small>KNOWLEDGE</small> <i>of the idiom or phraseology of
any language</i> <small>ALWAYS</small> <i>implies a previous knowledge
of the customs and manners of those to
whom it is vernacular</i>. What the Bishop asserts
is, <i>That an</i> <small>IMPRESSION</small> <i>of the phrases and
idioms of an inspired language implies a previous</i>
<small>IMPRESSION</small> <i>of the tempers, fashions, and
opinions of the people to whom the language is
native, upon the minds of them to who the
language is</i> <small>THUS</small> <i>imparted</i>: that is, if a knowledge
of the idioms had been <i>impressed</i>, a
knowledge of the customs and manners from
which those idioms arise, and without a knowledge
of which they could not be understood
(as they were to be, by the recipients of this
spiritual gift), must have been <i>impressed</i> likewise.
No, you say: a <i>knowledge</i> of the idiom
of a language does not <i>always</i> imply a previous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
<i>knowledge</i> of the manners. Who says, it does?
We may come to <i>know</i> the idioms of languages,
without a <i>divine impression</i>: and
without such impression, for any thing appears
to the contrary, the Bishop might suppose the
sacred writers came by their knowledge, so far
as they possessed it, of the Greek idioms. But
the <i>impression</i> of such idioms could only come
from another and <i>previous impression</i> of the
customs and manners: because in this case,
without a previous impression of the <i>customs
and manners</i>, the <i>idioms</i> themselves, when
impressed, could not have been understood,
nor consequently put to use, by the persons
on whom this impression was made. They had
no time to recur to Lexicons, Grammars, and
Commentaries to know the meaning of the impressed
idioms. How then were they, on the
instant, to know their meaning at all, but by
a <i>previous impression</i> of the manners, from
which they arose, and which would put them
into a capacity of understanding these impressed
idioms?</p>

<p>In a word, the Bishop is speaking of <small>SUPERNATURAL
IMPRESSION</small>: you, of <small>NATURAL KNOWLEDGE</small>.
No wonder, then, your reasoning and
your learning, in the concluding pages of this
chapter, should look entirely <i>beside</i> the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
in hand, or, at best, should look so <i>askew</i> on
the Bishop’s <i>hazardous</i> position. It is certain,
you are far enough out of all danger of encountering
it, when you entrench yourself, at length,
behind this distant and secure conclusion—“that
the knowledge of idiom is so far from
requiring, or implying a previous one of
tempers, manners, <i>&amp;c.</i> that the very <small>CONVERSE</small>
of this seems to be the safer principle;
and that tempers and manners are not to be
learned, without some degree of previous acquaintance
with the peculiarities of a language<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>:”
a proposition, which though exceptionable
enough, as you put it, and even
suggesting some pleasant ideas, I am in no
humour, at present, to contest with you.</p>

<p>This, <span class="smcap">Sir, is the whole</span> of what I find advanced
by you, that hath any shew or appearance
of being intended as a Confutation of the
argument by which the Bishop supports his
<span class="smcap">first Paradox</span>; in opposition to Dr. <span class="smcap">Middleton’s</span>
opinion, <i>That an inspired language
must needs be a language of perfect eloquence</i>.
The Bishop has told us in very accurate
terms what he conceives the character of
an inspired language must needs be: and I
have at least shewn, that the character he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
gives of it may be a just one, notwithstanding
any thing you have objected to it in your
learned Dissertation.</p>

<p>I now proceed to the Bishop’s <span class="smcap">second Paradox</span>;
which opposes Dr. <span class="smcap">Middleton’s</span> <i>second
Proposition, That eloquence is something
congenial and essential to human speech, and
inherent in the constitution of things</i>.</p>

<p>‘This supposes, says the Bishop, ‘that there
is some certain <span class="smcap">Archetype</span> in nature, to
which that quality refers, and on which it is
formed and modelled. And, indeed, admitting
this to be the case, one should be apt
enough to conclude, that when the Author of
nature condescended to inspire one of these
plastic performances of human art, he would
make it by the exactest pattern of the
<i>Archetype</i>.</p>

<p>‘But the proposition is fanciful and false.
Eloquence is not congenial or essential to human
speech, nor is there any Archetype in
nature to which that quality refers. It is accidental
and arbitrary, and depends on custom
and fashion: it is a mode of human
communication which changes with the
changing climates of the Earth; and is as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
various and unstable as the genius, temper,
and manners of its diversified inhabitants.
For what is <span class="smcap">Purity</span> but the use of such terms,
with their multiplied combinations, as the
interest, the complexion, or the caprice of a
writer or speaker of authority hath preferred
to its equals? What is <span class="smcap">Elegance</span> but such a
turn of idiom as a fashionable fancy hath
brought into repute? And what is <span class="smcap">Sublimity</span>
but the application of such images, as arbitrary
or casual connexions, rather than their
own native grandeur, have dignified and ennobled?
Now <span class="smcap">Eloquence</span> is a compound of
these three qualities of speech, and consequently
must be as nominal and unsubstantial
as its constituent parts. So that, that
mode of composition, which is a model of
<i>perfect eloquence</i> to one nation or people,
must appear extravagant or mean to another.
And thus in fact it was. Indian and Asiatic
eloquence were esteemed hyperbolic, unnatural,
abrupt and puerile to the more phlegmatic
inhabitants of <i>Rome</i> and <i>Athens</i>. And
the Western eloquence, in its turn, appeared
nerveless and effeminate, frigid or insipid, to
the hardy and inflamed imaginations of the
East. Nay, what is more, each species, even
of the most approved genus, changed its nature
with the change of clime and language;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
and the same expression, which, in one place,
had the utmost <i>simplicity</i>, had, in another,
the utmost <i>sublime</i><a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>.’</p>

<p>The Bishop then proceeds to illustrate this
last observation by a famous instance, taken
from the first chapter of <i>Genesis</i>, and then
recapitulates and enforces his general argument
in the following manner.</p>

<p>‘Apply all this to the books of the N. T. an
authorized collection, professedly designed for
the rule and direction of mankind. Now such
a rule demanded that it should be inspired of
God. But inspired writing, the objectors say,
implies the most <i>perfect eloquence</i>. What
human model then was the Holy Ghost to
follow? And a human model, of arbitrary
construction, it must needs be, because there
was no other: Or, if there were another, it
would never suit the purpose, which was to
make an impression on the minds and affections;
and this impression, such an eloquence
only as that which had gained the popular
ear, could effect. Should therefore the
<i>Eastern</i> eloquence be employed? But this
would be too inflated and gigantic for the
<i>West</i>. Should it be the <i>Western</i>? But this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
would be too cold and torpid for the <i>East</i>.
Or, suppose the <i>generic</i> eloquence of the
more polished nations was to be preferred,
which <i>species</i> of it was to be employed? The
rich exuberance of the Asiatic Greeks, or the
dry conciseness of the Spartans? The pure
and poignant ease and flowing sweetness of
the Attic modulation, or the strength and
grave severity of the Roman tone? Or should
all give way to that African torrent, which
arose from the fermented mixture of the dregs
of <i>Greece</i> and <i>Italy</i>, and soon after overflowed
the Church with theological conceits
in a sparkling luxuriancy of thought, and a
sombrous rankness of expression? Thus various
were the species’s! all as much decried
by a different genus, and each as much disliked
by a different species, as the eloquence
of the remotest East and West, by one another<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>.’</p>

<p>Thus far the learned Bishop, <i>with the spirit
and energy</i>, as you well observe, <i>of an ancient
orator</i><a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>; and, let me add, with a justness and
force of reasoning, which would have done honour
to the best ancient Philosopher. But here
we separate again. You maintain, with Dr.
<span class="smcap">Middleton</span>, <i>that eloquence is something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
congenial and essential to human speech</i>:
While <i>I</i>, convinced by the Bishop’s reasoning
in these paragraphs, maintain that it assuredly
is not.</p>

<p>The subject, indeed, affords great scope to
your rhetorical faculties; and the cause, you
maintain, being that, as you conceive, of the
antient orators, and even of eloquence itself,
you suffer your enthusiasm to bear you away,
without controul; and, as is the natural effect
of enthusiasm, with so little method and precision
of argument, that a cool examiner of your
work hardly knows how to follow you, or
where to take aim at you, in your aery and
uncertain flight. However, I shall do my best
to reduce your Rhetoric to Reason; I mean,
to represent the substance of what you seem to
intend by way of argument against the Bishop’s
principle, leaving your eloquence to make what
impression on the gentle reader it may.</p>

<p>And, <small>FIRST</small>, in opposition, as you suppose,
to the Bishop’s tenet, “<i>That eloquence is</i> <small>NOT</small>
<i>something congenial and essential to human
speech</i>,” you apply yourself to shew, through
several chapters, that tropes, metaphors, allegories,
and universally what are called by Rhetoricians
<i>figures of speech</i>, are natural and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
necessary expressions of the passions, and have
their birth in the very reason and constitution
of things. To make out this important point
is the sole drift of your <small>I</small>, <small>II</small>, <small>III</small>, and <small>IV</small>ᵗʰ
Chapters; in which you seem to me to be contending
for that which nobody denies, and to
be disputing without an opponent. At least,
you can hardly believe that the Bishop of
<i>Gloucester</i> is to be told, that metaphors, allegories,
and similitudes are the offspring of nature
and necessity, <span class="smcap">He</span>, who has, <i>with the utmost
justness and elegance of reasoning</i>, as
you well observe<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>, explained this very point,
himself, in the <span class="smcap">Divine Legation</span>.</p>

<p>What then are we to conclude from these
elaborate chapters? Why, that by some unlucky
mistake or other, let us call it only by
the softer name, of <i>inattention</i>, you have entirely
misrepresented the scope and purpose of
all the Bishop has said on the subject of eloquence.
And that this is no hasty or groundless
charge, but the very truth of the case, will
clearly be seen from a brief examination of the
Bishop’s theory, compared with your reasonings
upon it.</p>

<p>The position, <i>that eloquence is something
congenial and essential to human speech, supposes</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
says the Bishop, <i>that there is some certain
Archetype in nature, to which that quality
refers, and on which it is to be formed
and modelled</i>.</p>

<p>The Bishop, you see, requires an <i>Archetype</i>
to be pointed out to him of that consummate
eloquence, which is said to be <i>congenial and
essential to human speech</i>. The demand is
surely reasonable; and not difficult to be complied
with, if such an Archetype do, in fact,
subsist. But do you know of any such? Do
you refer him to any such? Do you specify
that <i>composition</i>? or do you so much as delineate
that <i>sort</i> of composition, which will pass
upon all men under the idea of an Archetype?
Nothing of all this. Permit us then to attend
to the Bishop’s reasoning, by which he undertakes
to prove that no such Archetype does or
can exist.</p>

<p>‘The proposition [that asserts, there is such
an Archetype] is fanciful and false. Eloquence
is not congenial or essential to human
speech, nor is there any Archetype in nature
to which that quality refers. It is accidental
and arbitrary, and depends on custom and
fashion: It is a mode of human communication
which changes with the changing climates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
of the earth; and is as various and
unstable as the genius, temper, and manners
of its diversified inhabitants<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>.’</p>

<p>The Bishop asserts <i>there is no Archetype</i>,
because eloquence is a variable thing, depending
on custom and fashion; is nothing absolute
in itself; but relative to the fancies and prejudices
of men, and changeable, as the different
climes they inhabit. This <i>general</i> reason seems
convincing: it appeals to fact, to experience, to
the evidence of sense. But the learned Prelate
goes further. He analyzes the complex idea of
eloquence: he examines the qualities of speech,
of which it is made up; and he shews that they
are nominal and unsubstantial. Hence it follows,
again, That there is no Archetype in nature of
perfect eloquence; its very constituent parts, as
they are deemed, having no substance or reality
in them.</p>

<p>But why should the Bishop condescend to this
analysis, when his <i>general argument</i> seemed
decisive of the question? For a good reason.
When the Bishop asked for an <span class="smcap">Archetype</span>,
though you are shy of producing any, he well
knew that the masters of Eloquence, those I
mean who are accounted such in these parts of
the world, had pretended to give one. He knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
the authority of these masters of human speech
with the sort of men, he had to deal with: he
therefore takes the Archetype, they have given,
and shews, upon their own ideas of eloquence,
it is a mere phantom.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the Bishop, in
touching incidentally the question of Eloquence
in a theological treatise, should follow the Greek
and Latin rhetors through all the niceties and
distinctions of their Art, or should amuse himself
or us with a minute detail of all the particulars
which go to the making up of this mighty
compound, their <span class="smcap">Archetypal idea</span> of human
eloquence. If he had been so pleased, and had
had no better business on his hands, it is likely
he could have told us <i>news</i>, as you have done,
out of <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span>, <span class="smcap">Longinus</span>, and <span class="smcap">Cicero</span>.
But his manner is to say no more on a subject,
than the occasion makes necessary; which, in
the present case, was no more than to acquaint
his reader, in very general terms, with the constituent
parts of eloquence; which he resolves
into these three, <span class="smcap">Purity</span>, <span class="smcap">Elegance</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Sublimity</span>.</p>

<p>But this you call <i>a most illogical division of
Eloquence; for that the Bishop hath not only
enumerated the constituent parts imperfectly;
but, of the three qualities which he hath exhibited,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
the first is included in the second, and
the third is not necessarily and universally a
part of eloquence</i><a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>enumeration</i>, you say, <i>is imperfect</i>.
Yet <i>Purity</i>, I think, denotes whatever comes
under the idea of <small>PROPRIETY</small>, that is, of approved
custom, as well as grammatical use, in
any language: <i>Elegance</i>, expresses all those
embellishments of composition, which are the
effect of <span class="smcap">Art</span>: and I know no fitter term than
<i>Sublimity</i>, to stand for those qualities of eloquence,
which are derived from the efforts of
Genius, or <span class="smcap">natural Parts</span>. Now what else
can be required to complete the idea of Eloquence,
and what defect of logic can there be
in comprehending the various properties of human
speech under these three generic names?
The division is surely so natural and so intelligible,
that few readers, I believe, will be disposed
to object with you, <i>that the first of the three
qualities is included in the second, and that the
third is not necessarily and universally a part
of eloquence</i>.</p>

<p>But let the Bishop’s enumeration be ever so
<i>logical</i>, you further quarrel with his <i>idea</i> of
these three constituent parts of eloquence, and
his reasoning upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span></p>

<p>‘What; says his Lordship, is <span class="smcap">Purity</span> but
the use of such terms with their multiplied
combinations, as the interest, the complexion,
or the caprice of a writer or speaker of authority
hath preferred to its equals?’</p>

<p>This idea of purity in language you think
strange; and yet in the very chapter in which
you set yourself to contemplate and to reprobate
this <i>strange idea</i>, you cannot help resolving
<i>purity</i>, into <i>usage and custom</i>, that is, with
<span class="smcap">Quintilian</span>, into <i>consensum</i> (<i>eruditorum</i>);
which surely is but saying in other words with
the Bishop, that it consists <i>in the use of such
terms, with their multiplied combinations, as
the interest, the complexion, or the caprice of
a writer or speaker of Authority hath preferred
to its equals</i>—for <i>equals</i> they undoubtedly
were, till that usage or custom took place.
When this <i>consent of the learned</i> is once established,
every writer or speaker, who pretends
to <i>purity</i> of expression, must doubtless conform
to it: but previously to such consent, <i>purity</i> is
a thing arbitrary enough to justify the Bishop’s
conclusion, that this quality <i>is not congenial
and essential to human speech</i>.</p>

<p>Next, the Bishop asks, ‘What is <span class="smcap">Elegance</span>
but such a turn of idiom as a fashionable fancy
hath brought into repute?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>

<p>Here, again, you grow very nice in your inquiries
into the idea of <i>fancy</i>, the idea of
<i>fashion</i>, and I know not what of that sort.
In a word, you go on <i>defining</i>, and <i>distinguishing</i>
to the end of the chapter, in a way
that without doubt would be very edifying to
your young scholars in <i>Trinity College</i>, but,
as levelled against the Bishop, is certainly
unseasonable and out of place. For define <i>elegance</i>
that you will, it finally resolves into something
that <i>is not of the essence of human speech</i>, but
factitious and arbitrary; as depending much
on the taste, the fancy, the caprice (call it what
you please) of such writers or speakers, as have
obtained the popular vogue for this species of
eloquence, and so had the fortune to bring
the turn of idiom and expression, which
they preferred and cultivated, into general
repute.</p>

<p>‘Lastly,’ the Bishop asks, ‘What is <span class="smcap">Sublimity</span>
but the application of such images, as
arbitrary or casual connexions, rather than
their own native grandeur, have dignified and
ennobled?’</p>

<p>To this question you reply by asking another,
<i>Whether sublimity doth necessarily consist in
the application of images?</i> But, <i>first</i>, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
what is <i>called</i> Sublimity, <i>generally</i> consists
in the application of images, it is abundantly
sufficient to the Bishop’s purpose: <i>Next</i>, I
presume to say, that the sublime of eloquence,
or the impression which a genius makes upon
us by his expression, consists necessarily and
universally in the application of <i>images</i>, that
is, of bright and vivid ideas, which is the true,
that is, the received sense of the word, <i>images</i>,
(however rhetoricians may have distinguished
different kinds of them, and expressed them by
different names) in all rhetorical and critical
works. <i>Lastly</i>, I maintain that these bright
and vivid ideas are rendered <i>interesting</i> to the
reader or hearer from the influence of <span class="smcap">Association</span>,
rather than <i>of their own native dignity
and grandeur</i>: of which I could give so many
instances, that, for this reason, I will only give
your <i>own</i>, which you lay so much stress upon,
of <i>the famous oath, by the souls of those who
fought at</i> Marathon <i>and</i> Platæa<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>: where the
peculiar ideas of <i>interest</i>, <i>glory</i>, and <i>veneration</i>,
associated to the <i>image</i> or idea of the battle of <i>Marathon</i>
and <i>Platæa</i>, gave a sublime and energy
to this oath of <span class="smcap">Demosthenes</span>, <i>by the souls of
those that fought there</i>, in the conceptions of
his countrymen, which no other people could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
have felt from it, and of which you, Sir, with
all your admiration of it, have certainly a very
faint conception at this time.</p>

<p>I should here have dispatched this article of
<i>Sublimity</i>, but that you will expect me to take
some notice of your objection to what the Bishop
observes, ‘That this species of eloquence
changed its nature, with the change of clime
and language; and that the same expression,
which in one place had the utmost <i>simplicity</i>,
had, in another, the utmost <i>sublime</i><a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>:’ An
observation, which he illustrates and confirms
by the various fortune of the famous passage in
<i>Genesis, God said, Let there be light, and
there was light; so sublime</i>, in the apprehension
of <span class="smcap">Longinus</span> and <span class="smcap">Boileau</span>, and so <i>simple</i>,
in that of <span class="smcap">Huetius</span> and <span class="smcap">Le Clerc</span>.</p>

<p>To this pertinent illustration, most ingeniously
explained and enforced by the learned
Prelate, you reply with much ease, “That this
might well be, and even in the same place,”
and then proceed to <i>inform</i> him of I know not
what union between <i>simplicity</i> and <i>sublimity</i>;
though you <i>civilly</i> add, “That it is a point
known to every <small>SMATTERER</small> in criticism, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
these two qualities are so far from being inconsistent
with each other, that they are frequently
united by a natural and inseparable
union<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>.”</p>

<p>“Simplicity and <i>sublimity</i> may be found
together.” I think the proposition false, in
your sense of it, at least. But be it true, that
these qualities in expression may be found together.
What then? The question is of a
passage, where these qualities, in the apprehension
of great critics, are found separately;
the one side maintaining that it is merely
<i>simple</i>, the other, that it is merely <i>sublime</i>.
<i>Simplicity</i> is, here, plainly opposed to <i>sublimity</i>,
and implies the absence of it: <span class="smcap">Boileau</span>,
after <span class="smcap">Longinus</span>, affirming that the expression
<i>is</i>, and his adversaries affirming that it is <i>not</i>,
<i>sublime</i>. Can any thing shew more clearly,
that the <i>sublime</i> of eloquent expression depends
on <i>casual associations</i>, and not on the nature
of things?</p>

<p>But the Bishop goes further and tells us,
what the <i>associations</i> were that occasioned these
different judgments of the passage in question.
The ideas suggested in it were <i>familiar</i>, to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
sacred writer: they were <i>new</i> and admirable,
to the Pagan Critic. Hence the expression
would be of the greatest <i>simplicity</i> in <span class="smcap">Moses</span>,
though it would be naturally esteemed by <span class="smcap">Longinus</span>,
infinitely <i>sublime</i>.</p>

<p>Here you cavil a little about the Effect of
<i>familiarity</i>: but, as conscious of the weakness
of this part of your answer, <i>Not to insist</i>, you
say, <i>upon this, How comes it then that</i> <span class="smcap">Boileau</span>
<i>and many other Christian readers, to whom
the ideas of creation were as familiar as to</i>
<span class="smcap">Moses</span> <i>himself, were yet affected by the sublime
of this passage</i>? You ask, How this comes
to pass? How? Why in the way, in which
so many other strange things come to pass, by
<i>the influence of authority</i>. <span class="smcap">Longinus</span> had said,
the expression of this passage was <i>sublime</i>.
And when he had said this, the wonder is to find
two men, such as <span class="smcap">Huetius</span> and <span class="smcap">Le Clerc</span>, who
durst, after that, honestly declare their own
feelings, and profess that, to them, the expression
was <i>not</i> sublime.</p>

<p>But more on this head of <i>Authority</i> presently.</p>

<p>You see, Sir, I pass over these chapters <i>on
the qualities of Eloquence</i>, though they make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
so large a part of your <i>Dissertation</i>, very rapidly:
and I do it, not to escape from any
force I apprehend there to be in your argument
or observations, but because I am persuaded
that every man, who knows what language is,
and how it is formed, is so convinced that those
qualities of it by which it comes to be denominated
<i>pure</i>, and <i>elegant</i>, and <i>interesting</i>,
are the effects of <i>custom</i>, <i>fashion</i>, and <i>association</i>,
that he would not thank me for employing
many words on so plain a point. Only, as
you conclude this part of your work with <i>an
appeal</i>, which you think sufficiently <i>warranted,
against the most positive decisions of fashion,
custom, or prejudice, to certain general and
established principles of rational criticism</i>,
subversive, as you think, of the Bishop’s whole
theory, I shall be bold to tell you, as I just
now promised, what my opinion is, <i>of these
established rules of</i> <small>RATIONAL CRITICISM</small>: by
which you will understand how little I conceive
the Bishop’s system to be affected by this confident
appeal to <i>such principles</i>.</p>

<p>I hold then, that what you solemnly call <i>the
established principles of rational criticism</i> are
only such principles as criticism hath seen good
to establish <i>on the practice of the Greek and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
Roman speakers and writers</i>; the European
eloquence being ultimately the mere product
and result of such practice; and European criticism
being no further <i>rational</i> than as it accords
to it. This is the way, in which ancient
and modern critics have gone to work in forming
their systems: and their systems deserve to
be called <i>rational</i>, because they deliver such
rules as experience has found most conducive
to attain the ends of eloquence in these parts
of the world. Had you attended to this obvious
consideration, it is impossible you should
have alarmed yourself so much, as you seem to
have done, at the Bishop’s bold Paradox, as if
it threatened the downfall of Eloquence itself:
which, you now see, stands exactly as it did,
and is just as secure in all its established rights
and privileges on the Bishop’s system of <i>there
being no Archetype of Eloquence in nature</i>, as
upon your’s, <i>that there is one</i>. The rules of
criticism are just the same on either supposition,
and will continue the same so long as we take
the Greek and Roman writers for our masters
and models; nay, so long as the influence of
their authority, now confirmed and strengthened
by the practice of ages, and struck deep
into the European notions and manners, shall
subsist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span></p>

<p>You need, therefore, be in no pain for the
interests of Eloquence, which are so dear to
you; nor for the dignity of your <i>Rhetorical
office</i> in the University of <i>Dublin</i>; which is
surely of importance enough, if you teach your
<i>young hearers</i> how to become eloquent in that
scene where their employment of it is likely to
fall; without pretending to engage them in certain
chimerical projects how they may attain
an essential universal eloquence, or such as
will pass for eloquence in all ages and countries
of the world.</p>

<p>You see, Sir, if this opinion of mine be a
truth, that it overturns at once the whole structure
of your book. We, no doubt, who have
been lectured in Greek and Roman eloquence,
think it preferable to any other; and we think
so, because it conforms to certain rules which
our criticism has established, without considering
that those rules are only established on the
successful practice of European writers and
speakers, and are therefore no rules at all in
such times and places where a different, perhaps
a contrary, practice is followed with the
same success. Let a Spartan, an Asiatic, an
African, a Chinese system of rhetoric be given:
Each of these shall differ from other, yet each
shall be best and most <i>rational</i>, as relative to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
people for whom it is formed. Nay, to see how
groundless all your fancies of a <i>rational essential
eloquence are</i>, do but reflect that even the
European eloquence, though founded on the
same general principles, is yet different in different
places in many respects. I could tell
you of a country, and that at no great distance,
where that which is thought supremely <i>elegant</i>
passes in another country, not less conversant
in the <i>established principles of rational criticism</i>,
for <small>FINICAL</small>; while what, in this country,
is accepted under the idea of <i>sublimity</i>, is derided,
in that other, as no better than <small>BOMBAST</small>.</p>

<p>What follows, now, from this appeal to <i>experience</i>,
against your appeal to the <i>established
rules of criticism</i>? Plainly this: That all the
rhetors of antiquity put together are no authority
against what the Bishop of <i>Gloucester</i> asserts
concerning the nature of eloquence; since
<small>THEY</small> only tell us (and we will take their word
for it) what will <i>please or affect</i> under <i>certain</i>
circumstances, while the <span class="smcap">Bishop</span> only questions
whether the same rules, under <small>ALL</small> circumstances,
will enable a writer or speaker to
<i>please and affect</i>. Strange! that you should
not see the inconsequence of your own reasoning.
The Bishop says, The rules of eloquence
are for the most part, local and arbitrary: No,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
you say, The rules are not local and arbitrary,
<small>FOR</small> they were held reasonable ones at <i>Athens</i>
and <i>Rome</i>. Your very answer shews that they
were local and arbitrary. You see, then, why
I make so slight on this occasion of all your
multiplied citations from the ancient writers,
which, how respectable soever, are no decisive
authority, indeed no authority at all, in the present
case.</p>

<p>Hitherto, the Bishop had been considering
eloquence <small>ONLY SO FAR</small> as it is founded in arbitrary
principles and local prejudices. For,
though his expression had been general, he
knew very well that his thesis admitted some
limitation; having directly affirmed of <i>the various
modes of eloquence</i>, not that they were
altogether and in all respects, but <small>MOSTLY</small>, <i>fantastical</i>
(p. 67), which, though you are pleased
to charge it upon him as an <i>inconsistency</i><a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>, the
reader sees is only a necessary qualification of
his general thesis, such as might be expected
in so exact a writer as the learned Bishop. He
now then attends to this limitation, and considers
what effect it would have on his main
theory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span></p>

<p>‘It will be said, <i>Are there not some more
substantial principles of eloquence, common to
all</i> the various species that have obtained in
the world?—Without doubt, there are.—Why
then should not these have been employed,
to do credit to the Apostolic inspiration?
For good reasons: respecting both
the speaker and the hearers. For, what <i>is</i>
eloquence but a persuasive turn given to the
elocution to supply that inward, that conscious
persuasion of the speaker, so necessary
to gain a fair hearing? But the first preachers
of the Gospel did not need a succedaneum to
that inward conscious persuasion. And what
is the <i>end</i> of eloquence, even when it extends
no further than to those more general principles,
but to stifle reason and inflame the
passions? But the propagation of Christian
truths indispensably requires the aid of reason,
and requires no other human aid<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.’</p>

<p>Here, again, you are quite scandalized at the
Bishop’s paradoxical assertions concerning the
<i>nature</i> and <i>end</i> of eloquence; and you differ as
widely from him now he argues on the supposition
of there being <i>some more substantial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
principles of eloquence</i>, as you did before, when
he contended that <i>most</i> of those we call principles
were arbitrary and capricious things.
You even go so far as to insult him with a
string of questions, addressed <i>ad hominem</i>: for,
having quoted some passages from his book,
truly eloquent and rhetorical, you think you
have him at advantage, and can now confute
him out of his own mouth.</p>

<p>“Can any thing,” you ask, “be more brilliant,
more enlivened, more truly rhetorical,
than these passages? What then are we to
think of the writer and his intentions? Is
he really sincere in his reasoning? or are
these eloquent forms of speech so many marks
of falshood? Were they assumed as <i>a succedaneum
to conscious persuasion</i>? And is
the end and design of them to <i>stifle reason
and inflame the passions</i><a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>?”</p>

<p>To blunt the edge of these sharp and pressing
interrogatories, give me leave to observe that
the main question agitated by the Bishop is,
whether divine inspiration can be reasonably
expected to extend so far as to infuse a perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
model of eloquence, and to over-rule the inspired
Apostles in such sort, as that all they
write or speak should be according to the rules
of the most consummate rhetoric. He resolves
this question in the <i>negative</i>: <i>first</i>, by shewing
that there is no such thing as what would
be deemed a perfect model of eloquence subsisting
in nature; a great part of what is called
eloquence in all nations being arbitrary and chimerical;
and, <i>secondly</i>, by shewing that even
those principles, which may be justly thought
more substantial, were, for certain reasons, not
deserving the solicitous and over-ruling care of
a divine inspirer. His reasons are these: <i>First</i>,
that eloquence, when most genuine, <i>is but a
persuasive turn given to the elocution to supply
that inward, that conscious persuasion of the
speaker, so necessary to gain a fair hearing,
and which the first preachers of the Gospel
had already</i>, by the influence and impression
of the holy Spirit upon their minds: And, <i>next,
that the end of eloquence, even when it extends
no further than to those more general principles,
is but to stifle reason and inflame the
passions</i>; an <i>end</i> of a suspicious sort, and
which the propagation of Christian truths, the
proper business of the sacred writers or speakers,
did not require.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span></p>

<p>You see these <i>reasons</i>, in whatever defective,
are both of them founded in <i>one common</i>
principle, which the Bishop every where goes
upon, and the best philosophy warrants, That,
when the Deity interposes in human affairs, he
interposes no further than is <i>necessary</i> to the
end in view, and leaves every thing else to the
intervention and operation of second causes.
The Apostles wanted <small>NO</small> succedaneum to an
inward conscious persuasion, which the observance
of the general principles of eloquence
supplies; they were not, therefore, supernaturally
instructed in them. They wanted <small>NO</small> assistance
from a power that tends <i>to stifle reason
and inflame the passions</i>: it was not, therefore,
miraculously imparted to them. Every
thing here is rational, and closely argued. What
was not necessary was not done. Not a word
about the inconvenience and inutility, in all
cases, of recurring to the rules and practice of
a chaste eloquence: not a word to shew that,
where eloquence is employed, there is nothing
but fraud and <i>falshood</i>, no inward persuasion,
no consciousness of truth: not a word to insinuate
that either you or the Bishop should be
restrained from being as eloquent on occasion
as you might have it in your power to be, or
might think fit: nay, not a word against the
Apostles themselves having recourse to the aids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
of human eloquence, if they had access to them,
and found them expedient; only these aids
were not <small>REQUIRED</small>, that is, were not to be
claimed or expected from divine inspiration.</p>

<p>Thus stands the Bishop’s reasoning, perfectly
clear and just. The only room for debate is,
whether his ideas of the <i>nature</i> and <i>end</i> of eloquence
be just, too. <i>Eloquence</i>, he says, <i>is
but a persuasive turn given to the elocution, to
supply that inward, that conscious persuasion
of the speaker, so necessary to gain a fair
hearing</i>. The general affirmation you do not,
indeed cannot, reject or controvert; for, the
great master of eloquence himself confirms it
in express words—<i>Tum optimè dicit orator,
cum</i> <small>VIDETUR</small> <i>vera dicere</i>. <span class="smcap">Quinctil.</span> l. iv. c. 2.
And, again, <i>Semper ita dicat</i>, <small>TANQUAM</small> <i>de
causâ optimè sentiat</i>. l. v. c. 13; that is, an
inward conscious persuasion is to be supplied
by the speaker’s art. The Bishop’s idea then
of the <i>nature</i> of eloquence is, as far as I can
see, the very same idea which <span class="smcap">Quinctilian</span> had
of it. Both agree, that eloquence is <i>such a
turn of the elocution as supplies that inward
conscious persuasion so necessary to the speaker’s
success</i>. The Bishop adds, that this <i>supply</i>
the inspired writers did not want. But you
will say, perhaps, that merely human writers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
may have this <i>inward conscious persuasion</i>, as
well as the inspired. What then? if human
writers can do without this succedaneum, which
human eloquence supplies to inward persuasion,
who obliges them to have recourse to it? Yes,
but they cannot do <i>so well</i> without it. Who
then forbids them to have recourse to it? For,
neither are the inspired writers barred of this
privilege: only, as being simply <small>UNNECESSARY</small>,
it was not præternaturally supplied. Your perplexity
on this subject arises from not distinguishing
between what is <i>absolutely necessary</i>,
and what is <i>sometimes expedient</i>: Divine inspiration
provides only for the <i>first</i>; the <i>latter</i>
consideration belongs to human prudence.</p>

<p>But it would be, further, a mistake to say,
<i>that merely human writers have their inward
conscious persuasion as well as the divine</i>.
They may have it, indeed, from the conclusions
of their own reason, but have they it in the
same degree of strength and vivacity, have they
the same <i>full assurance of faith</i>, as those who
have truth immediately impressed upon them
by the hand of God? I suppose, not.</p>

<p>But the Bishop’s idea of the <small>END</small> of eloquence
revolts you as much as his idea of its <i>nature</i>.
<i>What</i>, says he, <i>is the</i> <small>END</small> <i>of eloquence, even
when it extends no further than to those more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
general principles, but to stifle reason and inflame
the passions</i>? And what other end, I
pray you, can it have? You will say, To adorn,
recommend, and enforce truth. It may be so,
sometimes: this, we will say, is its more legitimate
end. But even this end is not accomplished
but by <i>stifling reason and inflaming
the passions</i>: that is, eloquence prevents reason
from adverting <i>simply</i> to the truth of things,
and to the force of evidence; and it does this
by agitating and disturbing the natural and
calm state of the mind with rhetorical <i>diminutions
or amplifications</i>. <span class="smcap">Vis</span> <i>oratoris</i> <small>OMNIS</small>,
says <span class="smcap">Quinctilian</span>, <i>in</i> <small>AUGENDO MINUENDOQUE</small>
<i>consistit</i>. [l. viii. c. 3. sub fin.] Now
what is this but <i>stifling reason</i>? But it goes
further: it <i>inflames the passions</i>, the ultimate
end it has in view from <i>stifling reason</i>, or putting
it of its guard. And for this, again, we
have the authority of <span class="smcap">Quinctilian</span>, <i>affectibus
perturbandus et ab intentione auferendus orator.
Non enim solum oratoris est docere, sed
plus eloquentia</i> <small>CIRCA MOVENDUM</small> <i>valet</i>. l. iv.
c. 5. Or, would you see a passage from the
great master of rhetoric, where his <i>idea</i> of this
double end of eloquence is given, at once; it
follows in these words—<i>Ubi</i> <small>ANIMIS</small> <i>judicum</i>
<small>VIS</small> <i>afferenda est, et</i> <small>AB IPSA VERI CONTEMPLATIONE</small>
<i>abducenda mens</i>, <small>IBI PROPRIUM ORATORIS
OPUS EST</small>. l. vi. c. 2. That is, where the <i>passions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
are to be inflamed, and reason stifled,
there is the proper use and employment of the
rhetorical art</i>. So exactly has the Bishop
traced the footsteps of the great master, when
he gave us his idea of the <small>END</small> of eloquence!</p>

<p>Well, but this <i>end</i>, you say, is <small>IMMORAL</small>. So
much the worse for your system; for such is
the undoubted end of eloquence, even by the
confession of its greatest patrons and advocates
themselves. But what? Is this end immoral
in all cases? And have you never then heared,
<i>that the passions</i>, as wicked things as they are,
<i>may be set on the side of truth</i>? In short,
Eloquence, like Ridicule, which is, indeed, no
mean part of it, may be either well or ill employed;
and though it cannot be truly said
that the end of either is simply <i>immoral</i>, yet it
cannot be denied that what these <i>modes of address</i>
propose to themselves in <small>ALL</small> cases is, <i>to
stifle reason and inflame the passions</i>.</p>

<p>The Bishop’s idea, then, of the end of eloquence,
I presume, is fairly and fully justified.
But your complaint now is, that the Bishop
does not himself abide by this idea. For you
find a contradiction between what his Lordship
says here—<i>that the</i> <small>END</small> <i>of eloquence, even
when it extends no further than to those more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
general principles, is but to style reason and
inflame the passions</i>, and what he says elsewhere—<i>that
the</i> <small>PRINCIPAL</small> <i>end of eloquence</i>,
<small>AS IT IS EMPLOYED IN HUMAN AFFAIRS</small>, <i>is to
mislead reason and to cajole the fancy and
affections</i><a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>. But these propositions are perfectly
consistent; nor was the <i>latter</i> introduced
so much as for the purpose of <i>qualifying and
palliating</i> any thing that might be deemed offensive
in the <i>former</i>. For though eloquence,
chastely employed, goes no further than to
<i>stifle reason and inflame the passions</i> (and
the chastest eloquence, if it deserves the name,
goes thus far), yet <i>the principal end of eloquence,
as it is employed in human affairs</i>, is
to <i>mislead</i> reason, which is something more
than <i>stifling</i> it; and to <i>cajole</i>, which is much
worse than to <i>inflame</i>, the passions. Reason
may be <small>STIFLED</small>, and the passions <small>INFLAMED</small>,
when the speaker’s purpose is to inculcate
<i>right and truth</i>: Reason is only in danger of
being <small>MISLED</small>, and the fancy and affections of
being <small>CAJOLED</small>, when wrong and error are enforced
by him. So very inaccurate was your
conception of the Bishop’s expression! which I
should not have explained so minutely, but to
shew you that, when you undertook to expose
such a writer, as the Bishop, you should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
studied his expression with more care, and
should have understood the force of words at
another rate, than you seem to have done in
this instance.</p>

<p>Still you will ask, if the <i>end</i> be so legitimate,
why should not the inspired writers be
trusted with this powerful engine of human
eloquence? The Bishop gives several reasons:
It is a <i>suspicious instrument</i>, p. 57. It was an
<i>improper</i> instrument for heaven-directed men,
whose strength was not to be derived from <i>the
wisdom of men</i>, but from <i>the power of God</i>,
p. 59. But the direct and immediate answer is
contained, as I observed, in these words—<i>The
propagation of Christian truths indispensably
requires the aid of reason, and requires no
other aid</i>. 1. Christianity, which is <i>a reasonable
service</i>, was of necessity to be propagated
by force of reason; in the Bishop’s better expression,
<small>IT INDISPENSABLY REQUIRED THE AID
OF REASON</small>; but <i>Reason</i>, he tells us in the
next words, <i>can never be fairly and vigorously
exerted but in that favourable interval which
precedes the appeal to the passions</i>. 2. The
Propagation of Christianity, which indispensably
required the aid of reason, <small>REQUIRED NO
OTHER HUMAN AID</small>: that is, no other human
means were simply <small>REQUISITE</small> or <small>NECESSARY</small>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
God, therefore, was pleased to leave his inspired
servants to the prudential use and exercise of
their own natural or acquired talents; but
would not supernaturally endow them with this
<i>unnecessary</i> power of eloquent words. The
inspired writers, even the most learned and, by
nature, the most eloquent of them, made a very
sparing use of such talents, <i>proudly sacrificing
them</i>, as the Bishop nobly and eloquently says,
<i>to the glory of the everlasting Gospel</i>. But
as the <i>end</i> was not, so neither was the <i>use</i> of
eloquence, simply immoral or evil in itself.
They were considerations of <i>propriety</i>, <i>prudence</i>,
and <i>piety</i>, which restrained the Apostles
generally, but not always, in the use of
eloquence; which was less <i>decent</i> in their case,
and which they could very well do without.
When the same considerations prompt other
men, under other circumstances, to affect the
way of eloquence, it may safely, and even
commendably, for any thing the Bishop has
said on this subject as it concerns divine inspiration,
be employed.</p>

<p>Admitting then the Bishop’s ideas both of
the <i>nature</i> and <i>end</i> of eloquence, the <i>want</i> of
this character in the sacred writings is only
vindicated, not <i>the thing itself</i> interdicted or
disgraced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span></p>

<p>The conclusion from the whole of what the
Bishop has advanced on this argument, follows
in these words:</p>

<p>‘What, therefore, do our ideas of fit and
right tell us is required in the <i>style</i> of an
universal law? Certainly no more than this—To
employ those aids which are common to
<i>all</i> language as such; and to reject what is
peculiar to <i>each</i>, as they are casually circumstanced.
And what are these aids but <small>CLEARNESS</small>
and <small>PRECISION</small>? By these, the mind and
sentiments of the Composer are intelligibly
conveyed to the reader. These qualities are
essential to language, as it is distinguished
from jargon: they are eternally the same, and
independent on custom or fashion. To give
a language <i>clearness</i> was the office of Philosophy;
to give it <i>precision</i> was the office of
Grammar. Definition performs the first service
by a resolution of the ideas which make
up the terms: Syntaxis performs the second
by a combination of the several parts of
speech into a systematic congruity: these are
the very things in language which are least
positive, as being conducted on the principles
of metaphysics and logic. Whereas, all besides,
from the very power of the elements,
and signification of the terms, to the tropes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
and figures of composition, are arbitrary;
and, what is more, as these are a deviation
from those principles of metaphysics and
logic, they are frequently vicious. This, the
great master quoted above [<span class="smcap">Quinctilian</span>]
freely confesseth, where speaking of that ornamented
speech, which he calls σχήματα
λέξεως, he makes the following confession
and apology—esset enim omne schema <small>VITIUM</small>,
si non peteretur, sed accideret. Verum
auctoritate, vetustate, consuetudine, plerumque
defenditur, sæpe etiam <small>RATIONE QUADAM</small>.
Ideoque cum sit a simplici rectoque loquendi
genere deflexa, <i>virtus</i> est, si habet <small>PROBABILE
ALIQUID</small> quod sequatur<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>.’</p>

<p>There is no part of your book in which you
exult more than in the confutation of this
obnoxious paragraph. It is to be hoped, you
do it on good grounds—but let us see what
those grounds are.</p>

<p>The Bishop, in the paragraph you criticize
in your vᵗʰ Chapter, had said <i>that tropes and
figures of composition</i>, under certain circumstances,
there expressed, are frequently <i>vicious</i>.
You make a difficulty of understanding this
term, and doubt whether his Lordship means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
<i>vice</i> in a <i>critical</i>, or <i>moral</i> sense. I take upon
me to answer roundly for the Bishop, that he
meant <i>vice</i> in the <i>critical</i> sense: for he pronounces
such tropes and figures <i>vicious</i>, <small>ONLY</small>
<i>as they are a deviation from the principles of</i>
<small>METAPHYSICS AND LOGIC</small>; and therefore I presume
he could not mean <i>vice</i> in the other
sense, which is <i>a deviation from the principles
of</i> <small>ETHICS</small>. All you say on this subject, then,
might have been well spared.</p>

<p>This incidental question, or doubt of your’s,
being cleared up, let us now attend to the <i>more
substantial grounds</i> you go upon, in your censure
of the learned Bishop.</p>

<p>He had been speaking of <i>clearness</i> and <i>precision,
as the things in language, which are
least positive. Whereas, all besides, from the
very power of the elements and signification
of the terms, to the tropes and figures of
composition, are arbitrary; and, what is more,
as these are a deviation from the principles of
metaphysics and logic, are frequently vicious.</i></p>

<p>In <i>the first place</i>, you say, <i>it were to be
wished that his Lordship had pleased to express
himself with a little more precision</i>—<i>Want
of precision</i> is not, I think, a fault with
which the Bishop’s writings are commonly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
charged; and I wish it may not appear in this
instance, as it did lately in another, that your
misapprehension of his argument arises from
the very <i>precision</i> of his expression. But in
what does this supposed <i>want of precision</i>
consist? Why, in not qualifying this sentence,
passed on <i>the tropes and figures of
Composition</i>, which, from the general terms,
in which it is delivered, falls indiscriminately
upon <small>ALL</small> writers and speakers; for that “<small>ALL</small>
men, who have ever written and spoken,
have <i>frequently</i> used this mode of elocution,
which is said to be <i>frequently</i> vicious<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>.”
Well, but from the word, <i>frequently</i>, which
you make yourself so pleasant with, it appears
that the Bishop <i>had</i> qualified <i>this bold and
dangerous position</i>.—Yes, but this makes the
position <i>still more bold</i>. Indeed! The Bishop
is then singularly unhappy, to have his position,
<i>first</i>, declared bold for want of being
qualified, and, <i>then</i>, bolder still, for being so.
But your reason follows.</p>

<p>“What makes this position still more hardy
is, that, however the conclusion seems confined
and restrained by the addition of that
qualifying word [frequently], yet the premises
are general and unlimited. It is asserted
without any restriction, that figurative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
composition is a deviation from the principles
of metaphysics and logic. If then it be
vicious <i>as</i> it is, i. e. <i>because</i> [<i>quatenus</i>] it is
such a deviation, it must be not only <i>frequently</i>
but <i>always</i> vicious; a very severe
censure denounced against almost every
speaker, and every writer, both sacred and
prophane, that ever appeared in the world<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>.”</p>

<p>Here your criticism grows very logical; and,
notwithstanding the confidence I owned myself
to have in the <i>precision</i> of the Bishop’s style, I
begin to be in pain how I shall disengage him
from so exact and philosophical an objector.
Yet, as the occasion calls upon me, I shall try
what may be done. <i>As these</i> [tropes and figures
of composition] <i>are a deviation from the
principles of metaphysics and logic, they are
frequently</i> <small>VICIOUS</small>. Since the <i>Attribute</i> of
this proposition is so peculiarly offensive to
you, your first care, methinks, should have
been to gain precise and exact ideas of the <i>subject</i>;
without which it is not possible to judge,
whether what is affirmed of it be exceptionable,
or no.</p>

<p>By <i>tropes and figures of composition</i>, you
seem to understand <i>metaphors</i>, <i>allegories</i>, <i>similitudes</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
and whatever else is vulgarly known
under the name of <i>figures of speech</i>. For in
p. 27, you speak of <i>Allegories, Metaphors
and</i> <small>OTHER</small> <i>tropes and figures, which, you
say, are no more than comparisons and similitudes
expressed in another form</i>: And your
concern, throughout this whole chapter, is for
the vindication of <i>such tropes and figures</i> from
the supposed charge of their being <i>a deviation
from the principles of metaphysics and logic</i>.
But now, on the other hand, I dare be confident
that the Bishop meant these terms, not in
this <i>specific</i>, but in their <i>generic</i> sense, as expressing
any kind of change, deflexion, or deviation
from the plain and common forms of
language. I say, I am <i>confident</i> of this, 1.
because the precise sense of the words <i>is</i> such
as I represent it to be; and I have observed,
though, it seems, you have not, that the Bishop
is of all others the most <i>precise</i> in his expression.
2. Because <span class="smcap">Quinctilian</span> authorizes
this use of those terms, who tells us that—<i>per
tropos verti formas non verborum modo,
sed et sensuum, et compositionis</i>, l. viii. c. 6.
And as to <i>figuram</i>, he defines it to be (as
the word itself, he says, imports) <i>conformatio
quædam orationis, remota à communi et primum
se offerente ratione</i>, l. ix. c. 1. <i>words</i>,
large enough to take in every possible change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
and alteration of common language. So that
<i>all manners and forms</i> of language, different
from the common ones, may, according to
<span class="smcap">Quinctilian</span>, be fitly denominated <i>tropes and
figures of composition</i>. 3. I conclude this to
be the Bishop’s meaning, because the <i>specific
sense</i> of these words was not sufficient to his
purpose, which was to speak of <small>ALL</small> kinds of
tropical and figured speech. Now though <i>allegories,
metaphors and other tropes and figures,
which are no more than comparisons
and similitudes, expressed in another form</i>,
belong indeed to the <i>genus</i> of figured language,
they are by no means the whole of it,
as so great a master of rhetoric, as yourself,
very well knows. 4. I conclude this, from the
<i>peculiar mode</i> of his expression: if the Bishop
had said simply <i>tropes and figures of speech</i>,
I might perhaps (if nothing else had hindered)
have taken him to mean, as you seem to have
done, only <i>metaphors, allegories, and other
tropes and figures, expressing, in another
form, comparisons and similitudes</i>, which, in
vulgar use, come under the name of <i>tropes and
figures of speech</i>: But when he departs from
that common form of expression, and puts it,
<i>tropes and figures of</i> <small>COMPOSITION</small>, I infer
that so exact a writer, as the Bishop, had his
reasons for this change, and that he intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
by it to express <i>more</i> than <i>tropes and figures
of speech</i> usually convey, indeed <small>ALL</small> that can
any way relate to the tropical and figurative
use of words in <i>literary composition</i>.</p>

<p>It is now seen what the <small>SUBJECT</small> of this bold
proposition is: namely, <i>tropical or figured
language, in general</i>. This figured language,
as it is a deviation from the principles of
metaphysics and logic, is frequently <i>vicious</i>; i. e. is
an acknowledged vice or fault in composition,
as such. We now then see the force of the
<span class="smcap">Predicate</span>.</p>

<p>Well; but if this figured language “be
vicious <i>as</i> it is, <i>i. e.</i> <i>because</i>, <i>quatenus</i>, it is
such a deviation, it must not only be <i>frequently</i>,
but <i>always</i> vicious.” The premises
are general and unlimited: so must, likewise,
be the conclusion. What sense, then, is there
in the word, <i>frequently</i>? or what room, for
that qualification?</p>

<p>See, what it is to be a great proficient in
logic, before one has well learnt one’s Grammar!
As, i. e. <i>because</i>, <i>quatenus</i>, say you.
How exactly and critically the English language
may be studied in <i>Dublin</i>, I pretend not
to say: But we in <i>England</i> understand the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
particle as, not only in the sense of <i>because</i>,
<i>quatenus</i>, but also, and, I think, more frequently,
in the sense of <i>in proportion as</i>, <i>according
as</i>, or, if you will needs have a Latin
term to explain an English term, <i>prout, perinde
ac</i>. So that the proposition stands thus:
<i>These tropes and figures</i>, <small>ACCORDING AS</small> <i>they
are a deviation from the principles of metaphysics
and logic, are frequently vicious</i>. The
premises, you now see, are qualified, as well
as the conclusion. Figured language, <small>WHEN</small> it
deviates from the principles of metaphysics and
logic, is—what? <i>always</i> vicious? But the
Bishop did not say, that figured language is
<i>always</i> a deviation from those principles. He
only says, <i>when</i> it so deviates, it is vicious. It
is implied in the expression that figured language
at least <i>sometimes</i> deviates from those
principles, and the Bishop, as appears, is of
opinion that it <i>frequently</i> deviates: He therefore
says, consistently with his premises, and
with his usual accuracy, It is <i>frequently</i>
vicious.</p>

<p>In short, the Bishop’s argument, about which
you make so much noise, if drawn out in mood
and figure, would, I suppose, stand thus—“Tropical
and figured language, <small>WHEN</small> it deviates
from the principles of metaphysics and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
logic, is vicious—Tropical and figured language
<small>FREQUENTLY</small> deviates from those principles—Therefore
tropical and figured language
is <small>FREQUENTLY</small> vicious.” And where
is the defect of sense or logic, I want to know,
in this argumentation? But you impatiently
ask, Are <i>metaphors, allegories, and comparisons</i>
then included in this <i>figured language</i>,
which is pronounced <i>vicious</i>? To this question
I can only reply, That I know not whether
<i>metaphors, allegories, and comparisons</i>,
are, in the Bishop’s opinion, <i>deviations</i> from
the principles of metaphysics and logic; for I
cannot find that he says any thing, in <i>particular</i>,
of this kind of tropes and figures. But if
you, or any one for you, will shew clearly, that
<i>metaphors, allegories, and comparisons</i> are
such <i>deviations</i>, the Bishop, for any thing I
know, might affirm, and might be justified in
affirming, that they were in themselves <i>vicious</i>.
But be not too much alarmed for your favourites,
if he should: They would certainly
keep their ground, though convicted of such
<i>vice</i>; at least unless the Rhetoricians of our
time should be so dull as not to be able to find
out what <span class="smcap">Quinctilian</span> calls <i>probabile aliquid</i>,
some probable pretext to justify or excuse
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span></p>

<p>But, instead of troubling ourselves to guess
what the Bishop <i>might</i> say on a subject on
which he has said nothing, it is to better purpose
to attend to what he <i>has</i> said, on the
subject in question. The Bishop <i>has</i> said,
<i>That tropical and figured language is frequently
vicious</i>. You ask when? He replies,
<i>When it deviates from the principles of metaphysics
and logic</i>. But in what particular
instances does this appear? He tells you this
too. He gives you instances enough, to justify
his affirmation, that tropical and figured language
is <i>frequently</i> vicious; for he exemplifies
his affirmation in <small>ONE WHOLE</small> class of such
figured speech, as deviates from the principles
of metaphysics and logic, and is therefore vicious,
namely, <i>in the class of verbal figures</i>.
‘This, [<i>i. e.</i> the truth of the affirmation, That
figured language, according as it is found to
be a deviation from the principles of metaphysics
and logic, is frequently vicious] the
great master, <span class="smcap">Quinctilian</span>, freely confesseth,
where, speaking of that ornamented speech,
which he calls σχήματα λέξεως, he makes the
following confession and apology—esset enim
omne schema <small>VITIUM</small>, si non peteretur, sed
accideret. Verum auctoritate, vetustate, consuetudine,
plerumque defenditur, sæpe etiam
<small>RATIONE QUADAM</small>. Ideoque cum sit à simplici<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
rectoque loquendi genere deflexa, <i>virtus est</i>,
si habet <small>PROBABILE ALIQUID</small> quod sequatur<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>.’</p>

<p>The difficulty, I trust, now begins to clear
up. Figured language, is frequently vicious.
Of this we have an instance given in one entire
species of figured or ornamented speech,
namely σχήματα λέξεως, or <i>verbal figures</i>.
Can any thing be clearer and plainer? Yet,
because you had taken it into your head that
by <i>tropes and figures of composition</i> the Bishop
understood, nay could only understand,
<i>metaphors, allegories, and comparisons</i>, you
dreamt of nothing, here, but the same fine
things. And though <span class="smcap">Quinctilian</span> lay before
the Bishop, when he quoted these words,
though the Bishop’s own express words shew
the contrary, for he speaks not of tropes and
figures in general, much less of such tropes
and figures as you speak of, but solely of <i>that
ornamented speech</i>, called σχήματα λέξεως, you
will needs have him quote <span class="smcap">Quinctilian</span> in this
place as speaking of <i>Rhetorical figures</i>. But
let us attend to <span class="smcap">Quinctilian’s</span> words. <i>Esset
omne schema vitium, si non peterentur, sed acciderent.</i>
What! Shall we think the Bishop
could mean to affirm of <i>rhetorical figures</i>, that
they would <i>always be vicious</i>, if they <i>were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
sought for, but occurred of themselves</i>? For
that, I think, is the translation of—<i>si non peterentur,
sed acciderent</i>. Surely one way, and
that the chief, in which <i>rhetorical figures,
metaphors, allegories, and comparisons</i>, become
vicious, is, when they <small>ARE</small> <i>sought for,
sollicitously hunted after, and affectedly
brought in</i>. The very contrary happens with
regard to these verbal figures: they are vicious,
when they <i>are</i> <small>NOT</small> <i>sought for and purposely
affected</i>. I conclude then, that his Lordship,
who surely does not want common sense, and,
I think, understands Latin, did not, and could
not intend to exemplify his observation in the
case of <i>rhetorical figures</i>.</p>

<p>Still you are something puzzled and perplexed
by the Bishop’s observation. Admitting
him to mean, as his author does, <i>verbal figures</i>,
how can these be considered <i>as a deviation
from the principles of metaphysics and logic</i>?
How? Why, has not the Bishop told us, or,
if he had not, is it not certain in itself, that
<i>to give a language clearness is the office of
philosophy; and that Definition, a part of
Logic, performs that service by a resolution
of the ideas, which make up the terms</i>? But
these verbal figures are often a deviation from,
nay a willful defiance of, <i>all logical definition</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
Witness the very instance you and <span class="smcap">Quinctilian</span>
give us, in <span class="smcap">Virgil’s</span> <i>timidi damæ</i>. Logic defines
<i>Damæ</i> to be the <i>females</i> of that species
of animals called <i>Deer</i>. The figurative <span class="smcap">Virgil</span>
confounds this distinction by using this term
for the <i>males</i>, as well as females. But, universally,
<i>Grammar</i> itself, whose peculiar office
is to <i>give precision to language</i>, is a part
of logic: the Bishop says, <i>its rules are conducted
on the principles of Logic</i>. But <i>verbal
figures</i>, even when they do not offend against
the strictness of definition, are universally violations,
in some degree or other, of <i>Grammar</i>,
i. e. of <i>Logic</i>. Yet these violations of <i>Logical
Grammar</i>, <span class="smcap">Quinctilian</span> tells us, may be allowed,
<i>si habent probabile aliquid quod sequantur</i>;
that is, for some fantastical reason
or other, by which the masters of Rhetoric are
pleased to recommend them to us.</p>

<p>And now, Sir, let me ask, what becomes of
your fine comment on <span class="smcap">Quinctilian’s</span> chapter
concerning <i>verbal figures</i>, and, particularly, of
your nice distinction between these, and <i>rhetorical
figures</i>, which the Bishop, no doubt,
wanted to be informed of? The issue of your
exploits in Logic and Criticism is now seen to
be this, That you have grossly misrepresented
the Bishop; and needlessly, at least, explained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
<span class="smcap">Quinctilian</span>. <i>First</i>, you make the Bishop
talk of <i>rhetorical figures</i> <small>ONLY</small>, in the <i>specific</i>
sense of these terms, when his Lordship was
all the while speaking of <i>figured language, in
general</i>. <i>Next</i>, you make him deliver a bold
position concerning rhetorical figures, as being
<i>frequently</i> vicious, because <i>always</i> deviations
from the principles of metaphysics and logic;
when all he maintains, is, That figured language
is <small>FREQUENTLY</small> vicious, according as it
deviates from those principles; and, in particular,
that <i>that</i> part of figured speech, called
grammatical or verbal figures, is <small>ALWAYS</small>
vicious.</p>

<p>To conclude, if you had shewn any compunction,
or even common respect in exposing
what you took to be the Bishop’s absurdities
on this subject, I should have made a conscience
of laying you open on this head of
<i>Rhetorical and Grammatical figures</i>. As it
is, your unmerciful triumph over the poor Bishop
makes it allowable for me to lay your
dealing with him before the reader in all its
nakedness; and, after what has been said, I
cannot do it better than by letting him see how
the Bishop’s argumentation is represented by
you, as drawn out in your own words, and
that in full mood and figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span></p>

<p>“I should by no means,” say you, “willingly
misrepresent the argument of my Lord Bishop;
but upon repeated examination of the passage
here quoted, I must state it thus:</p>

<p>“Quinctilian declares, that what are called
grammatical figures are really no more than
faulty violations of grammatical rules, unless
when purposely introduced upon some reasonable
or plausible grounds.”</p>

<p>Therefore,</p>

<p>“He confesses that tropes and figures of
composition, as they are a deviation from the
principles of metaphysics and logic, are frequently
vicious.”</p>

<p>You add, “If this be a fair representation, it
were to be wished that the learned author <i>had
so far condescended to men of confined abilities</i>,
as to explain the connexion between these
two propositions<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>.”</p>

<p>As the <i>learned author</i>, I guess, may be better
employed than in this unnecessary task, which
you <i>wish</i> to impose upon him, I have taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
upon me to discharge that office, with less able
hands; and, yet, have <i>explained the connexion
between these two propositions</i> in such sort,
that, if I mistake not, we shall never hear more
from you, of any inconsistency between them.</p>

<p>I have <small>NOW</small>, Sir, gone through the several
particulars of your Dissertation, and have
shewn, I think, clearly and invincibly, that
all your objections to the Bishop’s paradoxical
sentiments on the subject of Eloquence are mistaken
and wholly groundless.</p>

<p>The <small>TWO</small> propositions his Lordship took upon
him to confute, 1. <i>That an inspired language
must needs be a language of perfect eloquence</i>;
and, 2. <i>That eloquence is something congenial
and essential to human speech, and inherent in
the constitution of things</i>: These two propositions,
I say, are so thoroughly confuted by the
Bishop, that not one word of all you say in any
degree affects his reasoning, or supports those
two propositions against the force of it. I am
even candid enough to believe that, on further
thoughts, you will not yourself be displeased
with this ill success of your attack on the learned
Prelate’s <i>principles</i>; which are manifestly calculated
for the service of religion and the honour
of inspired scripture. For, though you attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
to shew us in your two last chapters,
how the honour of inspired scripture may be
saved on <i>other principles</i>, yet allow me to say
that, for certain reasons, I much question the
validity of those principles; at least, that the
persons, most concerned in this controversy,
will by no means subscribe to them. If there
be an Archetype of eloquence in nature, ‘one
should be apt enough, as the Bishop says, to
conclude, that when the Author of nature condescended
to inspire one of these plastic performances
of human art, he would make it by
the exactest pattern of the Archetype<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>.’ Or,
whatever you and I and the Bishop might conclude,
assure yourself that the objectors to inspired
scripture will infallibly draw that conclusion.
And, when they do so, and fortify
themselves, besides, with the authority of so
great a master of eloquence, as yourself, it will
be in vain, I doubt, to oppose to them your
ingenious harangues and encomiums on the eloquent
composition of the sacred scriptures. Nay,
it would give you, no doubt, some pain to find
that, though they should accept your authority
for the truth of their favourite principle of there
being <i>an Archetype in nature of perfect eloquence</i>,
they would yet reject your <i>harangues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
and encomiums</i> with that disdain which is so
natural to them. The honour of sacred scripture
will then hang on a question of <i>Taste</i>: and unluckily
the objectors are of such authority in
that respect, that there is no appeal from their
decisions of it.</p>

<p>The contemplation of these <i>inconveniencies</i>,
together with the <i>love of truth</i>, determined me
to hazard this address to you. I will not deny,
besides, that the mere <i>justice</i> due to a great
character, whom I found somewhat freely, not
to say injuriously treated by you, was also, <i>one</i>
motive with me. If I add still <i>another</i>, it is
such as I need not disown, and which you, of all
men, will be the last to object to, I mean a
motive of <i>Charity</i> towards yourself.</p>

<p>I am much a stranger to your person, and,
what it may perhaps be scarce decent for me to
profess to you, even to your writings. All I
know of <small>YOURSELF</small>, is, what your book tells me,
that you are distinguished by an honourable
place and office in the University of <i>Dublin</i>:
and what I have heared of your <small>WRITINGS</small>,
makes me think favourably of a private scholar,
who, they say, employs himself in such works
of learning and taste, as are proper to instill a
reverence into young minds for the best models<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
of ancient eloquence. While you are thus creditably
stationed, and thus usefully employed,
I could not but feel some concern for the hurt
you were likely to do yourself by engaging in so
warm and so unnecessary an opposition to a
<i>writer</i>, as you characterize him, <i>of distinguished
eminence</i><a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>. Time was, when even with us on
this side the water, the novelty of this writer’s
positions, and the envy, which ever attends superior
merit, disposed some warm persons to
open, and prosecute with many hard words,
the unpopular cry against him, of his being a
bold and <small>PARADOXICAL</small> writer. But reflexion
and experience have quieted this alarm. Men
of sense and judgment now consider his Paradoxes
as very harmless, nay as very sober and
certain truths; and even vye with each other in
their zeal of building upon them, as the surest
basis, on which a just and rational vindication
of our common religion can be raised. This is
the present state of things with us, and especially,
they say, in the Universities of this kingdom.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, not without some surprize,
and, as I said, with much real concern, that I
found a gentleman of learning and education revive,
at such a juncture, that stale and worn-out
topic, and disgrace himself by propagating this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
clamour, of I know not what <i>paradoxical boldness</i>,
now long out of date, in the much-approved
writings of this great Prelate. Nor was
the dishonour to yourself, the only circumstance
to be lamented. You were striving,
with all your might, to infuse prejudices into
the minds of many ingenious and virtuous young
men; whom you would surely be sorry to mislead;
and who would owe you little thanks for
prepossessing them with unfavourable sentiments
of such a man and writer, as the Bishop
of <i>Gloucester</i>, they will find, is generally
esteemed to be.</p>

<p>These, then, were the considerations, which
induced me to employ an hour or two of leisure
in giving your book a free examination. I have
done it in as few words as possible, and in a
<i>manner</i> which no reasonable and candid man,
I persuade myself, will disapprove. I know
what apologies may be requisite to the learned
Bishop for a stranger’s engaging in this officious
task. But to you, Sir, I make none: It is
enough if any benefits to yourself or others
may be derived from it.</p>

<p>I am, with respect, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_62" href="#FNanchor_62" class="label">62</a> The reader sees I complaisantly allow the writer’s
representation of the cases both of <i>Pilate and Gallio</i>;
though much might, with good reason, be objected to each
of them. For, 1. If I should lay any stress on the <i>acts of
Pilate</i>, which, he owns, if admitted, would overturn the
whole use of his evidence, I should but follow in this the
best authorities, and those too supported by such reasonings
as the Inquirer would find it difficult to confute. And,
2. As to Gallio’s case, however inattentive he might be to
the fame of Paul’s miracles, the passage alledged is certainly
insufficient to prove it. Acts, chap. xviii. 17. For,
indeed, the Inquirer did not so much as apprehend the purpose
of the sacred writer in that whole narration; which
manifestly was not to signify to us Gallio’s inattention to the
Apostle’s miracles, but his candour, and prudent conduct in
refusing to interfere in religious matters, and in chusing
rather to overlook an act of violence done in his presence
(which, though strictly speaking illegal, he might probably
think not altogether undeserved of the malicious intolerating
Jew), than gratify the complainant’s passion in punishing
either Paul or his heathen advocates. For this is
the sense of those words, <i>He cared for none of these things</i>;
which the writer ought to have seen is so far from proving
Gallio’s disregard of miracles, that, had he been Paul’s
convert, the very same thing had been observed of him.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_63" href="#FNanchor_63" class="label">63</a> Aristeas.—The writers referred to in the margin are
<i>Strabo</i>, <i>Maximus Tyrius</i>, <i>Pliny</i>, and <i>Herodotus</i>. Of these,
the three first mention Aristeas <i>occasionally</i> only; and yet
Strabo calls him ανηρ γοης ει τις αλλος; and <i>Max. Tyrius</i> and
<i>Pliny</i>, though they explode miracles, yet plainly enough
declare the common creed to run in his favour. Max.
Tyrius in particular, after having given us his opinion of
his miracles, together with his reasons for pretending to
them, adds, <i>And Aristeas gained more credit by this pretension
to wonders and supernatural communications, than
Xenagoras, Xenophanes, or any other philosopher could have
acquired by relating the plain truth</i>. Και ην πιθανωτερος ταυτα
λεγων ὁ Αριστεας η ὁ Ξεναγορας η Ξενοφανης, η τις αλλος των εξηγησαμενων
τα οντα ὡς εχει. Lastly, the account Herodotus gives
us is so much to the credit of his miracles, that one cannot
imagine how the writer should think it to his purpose to
refer to him. For he <i>was</i>, indeed, delivering the popular
history of Aristeas; and therefore did, as might be expected,
represent him, not only as a worker of miracles,
but as much reverenced and <i>esteemed</i> for them. This he
attests upon his own knowledge of several cities, all concurring
in the firm belief of his miracles; and one of them
in particular transported by so religious a veneration of
him, as to erect a statue to his memory; which they also
caused to be set up in the most public part of their city,
and even close to one they had at the same time decreed to
Apollo. And for the historian himself, though in truth
the story be even foolish enough, yet so far is he from
speaking of it with disregard, that I am not certain if he
did not believe it, at least that part which relates to the
Metapontini; which, after the mention of some other
things from hearsay only, he introduces in the following
assured manner: “Thus far the report of these cities:
But what I am now going to relate, I <i>certainly know</i> to
have happened to the Metapontini in Italy, &amp;c.” Ταυτα
μεν αἱ πολεις αὑται λεγουσι, τα δε οιδα Μεταποντινοισι εν Ιταλιη
συγκυρησαντα, &amp;c. L iv. 15; and then mentions the affair which
gave occasion to the statue; which, he tells us, he saw
himself, placed, as I have said, and inscribed to the memory
of Aristeas.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_64" href="#FNanchor_64" class="label">64</a> The other impostors mentioned as not much esteemed
for their miracles are <i>Pythagoras</i>, <i>Jamblichus</i>, and <i>Adrian</i>;
though it is certain the writers of their lives lay great
stress upon them. <i>Jamblichus</i> and <i>Porphyry</i>, after enlarging
on several of Pythagoras’s miracles, which drew the
applause and admiration of his followers, appeal to current
fame for the credit of these, and of other still <i>diviner miracles</i>,
which, say they, <i>are related of him with an uniform</i>
and constant belief, μυρια δ’ ἑτερα θαυμαστοτερα και θειοτερα περι
τ’ ανδρος ὁμαλως και συμφονως ειρηται. (<i>Porph.</i> S. 28 and to
the same purpose, and nearly in the same words, <i>Jambl.</i>
S. 135). Jamblichus even goes so far, in speaking of the
Pythagorean fondness for miracles, as to assure us, that
they were conceived to prove the <i>divinity</i> of their authors,
and by that means to give a sanction to their <i>opinions and
doctrines</i>. την πιστιν των παρ’ αυτοις ὑποληψεων ἡγουνται ειναι ταυτην,
&amp;c. S. 140. <i>They conceive it, says he, to add a</i> <small>CREDIT</small> <i>and
authority to their doctrines, that the author of them was
a</i> <small>GOD</small>; <i>and therefore to the question, Who was Pythagoras?
their answer was, The hyperborean Apollo; and in proof of
this they alledge the miracle of his golden thigh. And yet</i>,
says the Inquirer, <i>Pythagoras was not much more esteemed
for his thigh of gold than one of flesh</i>. What pity is it, the
wit of this antithesis should be no better supported!</p>

<p>As for <i>Eunapius</i>, though he plainly disbelieved the silly
tale of the two boys of Gadara, yet, in relating it circumstantially
as he does, he clearly enough expresses his own
opinion of miracles, and acknowledges thereby the credit
they would bring his master, were they better attested, or
but fairly received.</p>

<p>The miracles of the emperors are well known. And as
their manifest intent was, of the one of them, to add a
credit, or, as Suetonius more strongly expresses it, an
<i>authority, and certain awfulness, befitting majesty</i>, to the
person of <i>Trajan</i>, and of the <i>other</i>, to inspire the hopes of
recovery into <i>Adrian</i>, so the relation of them by their
historians, as useful and subservient to those ends, is a
thorough confutation of what the author pretends about
the little regard paid to them. And here it may be proper
to observe, once for all, that the frequent narrations of
prodigies and miracles, of which all Pagan story and antiquity
is full, is infinitely a stronger argument for the high
credit of miracles amongst the heathens in general, than
any pretended <i>coolness, tranquillity, and indifference</i>, which
the writer’s warmth, in the prosecution of his favourite
novelty, leads him to imagine in the narrations themselves,
is, or can be, for the contrary opinion. Since <i>this</i> could
only shew the incredulity of the relaters; whilst the <i>relating</i>
them at all demonstrates the general good reception
they met with from the people.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_65" href="#FNanchor_65" class="label">65</a> This miracle was that of the fiery eruptions which
hindered the building of the temple at Jerusalem by <i>Julian</i>;
and which, falling into the hands of <i>Marcellinus</i>, might be
expected to be spoken of as a natural event. But this is
all: for, as to that <i>wonderful coolness and tranquillity</i>,
which the writer pretends to have discovered in the narration,
it is so far from appearing to me, that, on the
contrary, I see not how the historian could have expressed
himself with more emotion, without directly owning the
miracle. His words are these: Quum itaque rei fortiter
instaret Alypius, juvaretque provinciæ rector, <i>metuendi
globi flammarum prope fundamenta crebris assultibus erumpentes,
fecere locum, exustis aliquoties operantibus, inaccessum:

in answer to an harangue of Celsus, wherein he had expatiated
largely on the heathen miracles, and opposed
them with great confidence to the Christian. Upon which
the excellent Father observes with much force, “I know
not how it is that Celsus thinks proper to alledge
the heathen miracles as incontestably evident, and undoubted
facts; and yet affects to treat the Jewish and
Christian miracles recorded in our books as mere fables.
For why should not ours rather be thought true, and
those which Celsus preaches up fabulous? Especially,
since those were never <i>credited</i> by their own philosophers,
such as <i>Democritus</i>, <i>Epicurus</i>, and <i>Aristotle</i>; who

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_83" href="#FNanchor_83" class="label">83</a> The right understanding of what is meant by the Jews
<i>requiring a sign</i> is of such importance to the perfectly comprehending
several parts of the Gospel history, that I shall
be allowed to justify and illustrate the interpretation here
given by some further considerations. And,</p>

<p>1. If by σημειον is to be understood simply a <i>miracle</i>, then
it is not true that Jesus, whom Paul preached, was or could
be on that account a <i>stumbling block</i> to the Jews, it being
allowed on all hands that many and great miracles <i>did
shew forth themselves through him</i>. See John vii. 31. xi. 47.
But,</p>

<p>2. Notwithstanding this, and though it was owned in
the fullest manner by the chief priests and Pharisees themselves,
yet we find them very pressing for a <i>sign</i>, σημειον
[Matth. xii. 38. xvi. 1. Luke xi. 29.] and that too (which
is very remarkable) at the instant our Saviour had been
working a miracle before them; a degree of perversity
not rashly to be credited of the Jews themselves.</p>

<p>It is true this <i>sign</i> is sometimes called σημειον απο του ουρανου,
<i>a sign from Heaven</i>; which, if meaning any thing more
than σημειον, as explained above, i. e. a <i>test</i> or credential of
his heavenly or divine mission (and what can be more natural
than that the Jews should express by this name the
<i>only</i> mark they would admit of the Messiah’s coming from
Heaven?) I say, if any thing further be intended in it, it
must be either, 1. An outward, sensible display of the
Divine power, <i>indicating</i>, by some prodigious and splendid
appearance in the heavens, or actually <i>interposing</i>, in some
signal way, to <i>accomplish</i> the deliverance of Israel; and
then either way it falls in with and includes the interpretation
here given. Or else, 2. It must mean a <i>mere</i> prodigy,
asked out of wantonness, and for no other end than
to gratify a silly curiosity in beholding a wondrous sight
from Heaven: an interpretation, which, though maintained
by some good writers, is utterly unsupported by the
sacred accounts, calling it σημειον indiscriminately, without
as with the addition of του ουρανου; and shocking to common
sense, which makes it incredible that so frivolous a reason
as the being denied a <i>sign</i>, thus understood, could be, as
St. Paul asserts it was, <i>the stumbling-block</i> of infidelity to
the Jewish nation.</p>

<p>3. But what above all confirms and fixes this interpretation
is the tenor of our Saviour’s answer to the question
itself. For, upon the inquiry, <i>Master, shew us a sign</i>, &amp;c.
his constant reply was, <i>A wicked and adulterous generation
seeketh after a sign, and there shall no sign be given them
but that of the prophet Jonas: For</i>, &amp;c. As though he had
said, “A perverse and degenerate people, disregarding
the wisdom of my doctrines, and the power of my miracles—the
genuine marks and characteristics of the
Messiah—are yet crying out for the <i>test</i>, σημειον, of my
coming. I know the proud and ambitious sentiment of
your heart: but assure yourselves, God will not accommodate
his proceedings to your fond views and prejudices.
No such <i>test</i> shall be given you. One sure and
certain <small>TEST</small> indeed there shall be, over and above what
has yet been afforded; but to shew you how widely different
the Divine conduct is from your prescriptions, it
is such a one as ye shall least expect; the very reverse of
your hopes and expectations. It shall be that of the prophet
<i>Jonas</i>. <i>For, as Jonas was three days and three nights
in the whale’s belly</i>, so shall Christ (sad contradiction to
your conceit of temporal dominion!) be put to death by
the Jews, and <i>lie three days and three nights in the heart
of the earth</i>. And this event, so degrading of my character
with you, and so repugnant to your wishes, shall,
I readily foresee, so scandalize you, that, though my return
from the grave, like that of <i>Jonas</i> from the whale,
shall be in the demonstration of power, yet shall ye,
through the inveteracy of that prejudice, be so hardened,
as not to be convinced by it.”</p>

<p>The answer of our Saviour is related by <i>Matthew</i> and
<i>Luke</i> with some addition, but such as is further favourable
to this interpretation. For, upon their asking a sign, it
is plain he understood them to mean not a <i>miracle</i>, but a
<small>TEST</small>, by the question immediately put to them: <i>When it
is evening, ye say it will be fair weather; for the sky is red.
And in the morning, it will be foul to-day; for the sky is
red and lowering. O! ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face
of the sky, but can ye not discern the face of the times?</i>
“Are the appearances which, in the order and constitution
of nature, precede the changes of weather, a sign or test
to you of those changes? And are ye stupid and perverse
enough to neglect those which, by the Divine appointment,
are made the <i>sign</i> or <i>test</i> of the <small>TIMES</small>, of
the change of the Mosaic for the Christian dispensation?
How is it that ye do not collect this from my <i>miracles</i> and
<i>doctrine</i>, the ordinary and stated marks of this change,
but ye must perversely demand a <i>test</i> of it, which the
Scriptures nowhere promise, and the order and course
of God’s Providence disclaim?”</p>

<p>If, after all this, there can yet remain any doubt of the
truth of this comment, it will be effectually removed by an
authority or two from the other Evangelist, which the
reader will indulge me in just mentioning. In our Saviour’s
exerting an act of civil power, in scourging and driving
the money-changers out of the temple, the Jews require
him to shew the credentials of his authority, <i>What sign
shewest thou that thou doest these things?</i> The asking a miracle
in this case were impertinent; for that, how extraordinary
soever, could never prove to the Jews that he came invested
with the powers of the civil magistrate. The sign they
expected, then was evidently of another kind: an express
declaration, or open display, of the regal character and
office, evidencing his commission <i>to do such things</i>. Accordingly,
the reply of our Saviour was to the same effect
as before. <i>Jesus said unto them, destroy this temple, and in
three days I will raise it up</i>; for he spake, we know, <i>of
the temple of his body</i>. c. ii.</p>

<p>The next authority is in the sixth chapter, where we
have an account of the miracle of feeding <i>the five thousand</i>.
Upon the multitude’s following him after this, our Saviour
objects to them their neglect of miracles, which he presses
upon them as motives to their belief. <i>Ye seek me not, because
ye saw the miracles</i>, &amp;c. Now what do the Jews return
to this charge? Why, they fairly own it to be just, and,
what is more, give a reason for their conduct. Their
answer is to this effect: “Wherefore do you urge your
miracles thus constantly to us, as motives for our belief?
If you would have us trust and confide in you as the
Messiah, <i>Where is the sign?</i> For, as to your miracles so
often insisted on by you, we cannot admit them as proper
evidences of your commission. And indeed how should
we? for Moses wrought as great, if not greater wonders
than you. To confront your late boasted miracle of
feeding <i>the five thousand with five loaves</i>, did not he, as it
is written, <i>give our fathers bread from heaven</i>? What
miracle of yours can be more extraordinary? Yet <i>Moses</i>
could do this. The Messiah, therefore, of whom greater
things are promised, we expect to be <i>characterized</i> by
other <i>signs</i>. What work takest thou in hand, τι εργαζη?”
Here, at last, we see (and the reader will forgive the length
of the note for the sake of so clear conviction) that the
<i>sign</i> asked for, of what kind soever it might be, neither
<i>was</i> nor <i>could</i> be a miracle, since all such <i>signs</i> were rejected
by these inquirers upon <i>principle</i>.</p>

the Heathens, the parallel betwixt the Heathen and Protestant
rejection of miracles, and his Conclusion</i>, they seem
very little to concern either him, or me. For, 1. The
influence of idolatry is urged to prove, that the <i>religion</i>,
not <i>miracles</i>, of Jesus, <i>was hard to be admitted</i> (p. 352);
which, though true, has nothing <i>new</i> in it, and is, besides,
intirely foreign, if not contradictory, to his purpose.
2. <i>The parallel betwixt the Heathen and Protestant rejection
of miracles</i> derives all its little illustrative force from this
poor presumption, already confuted, that the Heathens
had universally <i>a contempt of miracles</i>. I said the parallel
drew its whole force from this fact, for unless it be true
that the Heathens universally disbelieved all miracles said
to be wrought amongst them, the case of their rejection
of Christian miracles, the reader sees, is widely different
from that of the Protestant rejection of the Popish. This
one circumstance then, to mention no others, overturns
the whole use of his parallel. But, 3. As to his conclusion,
the design and business of that is, I allow, something
extraordinary. It is to shew us, that his whole
force was not spent in this wearisome Inquiry, but that,
was he disposed for it, he <i>could</i> go on to answer other
objections against miracles (p. 408-9) and our common
Christianity, which had been already confuted to his
hands. For, having shewn us what he <i>could not</i> do with
an argument of his <i>own</i>, he was willing, it seems, to shew
us what he <i>could</i> do with those of <i>other writers</i>. For which
meritorious service he has my compliments and congratulations:</p>

is impowered to inflict which of the several censures

The words are <i>ignavos, &amp;c. suspensione graduum, carcere,

the same is the meaning of <small>PRO ARBITRIO SUO</small> in the Statute
<i>de Officio Procuratorum</i>; on which the <i>Inquirer</i> affects
to lay some stress (p. 32). “<i>Eum, qui deliquerit, primò

mulctam; tertiò verò si deliquerit, gravius, pro</i> <small>ARBITRIO

either of <i>passing sentence by his single authority</i> or <i>determining
the kind of punishment at his discretion</i>, neither way
can this expression be made to serve the cause in hand.

would have known that <i>suspension</i> is not merely an usage
of the University Court, as such, but was practised by the
Ecclesiastical Court of the Bishops or Archbishops, as long

complained, in their remonstrance against this very Statute
of Q. <i>Elizabeth</i>) “when they [the V. C. and Masters

to redress that wrong; it is too true, which <i>Livy</i>

of a superior to an inferior</i>; and, in another place,
p. 39. derides the notion of <i>citing the supreme Magistrate
before more supreme Delegates</i>. But how different were the
sentiments of a late learned Civilian on this head, from
those of this <i>little academical Lawyer</i>! Speaking of Mr.
<i>Campbell’s</i> case, in 1725. “There is, says he, a subordination
of jurisdiction in the University. The Vice-chancellor’s
jurisdiction is <i>inferior</i> to that of the Senate;
and upon Mr. <i>C—’s</i> saying, that he appealed to the
University, the <i>inferior jurisdiction</i> ceased and devolved
to the Senate, even before the inhibition. And, afterwards
in considering the proctor’s inhibition; <i>upon the
Appeal</i>, the Proctors represent the University, and are
in that case superior to the Vice-chancellor.—And I am
of opinion, that the Delegates in Mr. <i>C—’s</i> cause may,
upon the Proctor’s applying to them, <i>primo et ante omnia</i>
reverse the whole proceedings against him, in the
V. C’s court, <i>as an attentat upon the University’s jurisdiction</i>;
and may likewise inflict such censures, as the
Statutes impower them to make use of, for the breach
of the inhibition; all inhibitions being by Law, <i>sub
pænâ juris et contemptûs</i>.” Dr. <span class="smcap">Andrews</span>.</p>

taken by the tutor, that he believes <i>in his conscience</i> that

good reasons. But the force of this argument will not

<p>Reader, I can easily guess the sentiments which must
arise in thee, at the sight of this shocking paragraph. But
think not I have abused thee in this citation. They are
the author’s own words, as they lie in p. 65 of the <i>Inquiry</i>.
Well, but his reason? Why, “if it be remembered, that,
though oaths of this kind were exacted in order to prevent
the frequency of Appeals, they by no means had
their proper effect, the same number having been commenced
for the three years next after this regulation, as
in that towards the close of which it was first made.”
This provision of <i>oaths had not</i>, he says, <i>its proper effect</i>.
And how does this appear? Why, <i>because Appeals were
as frequent afterwards as before</i>. Now, any other man
would, surely, have inferred from hence, that “therefore
the Appeals made were not without good reason.” Not
so the <i>Inquirer</i>. He is of another spirit. Rather than give
any quarter to <i>Appeals</i>, let every tutor in the University be
an abandoned perjured villain. In very tenderness to this
unhappy writer, whoever he be, I forbear to press him farther
on such a subject.</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
